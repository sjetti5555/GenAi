Items
How is Dunkin' Rewards different from DD Perks?
Dunkin’ Rewards is our new rewards program, replacing DD Perks. The major differences are:
Earning points:
Dunkin’ Rewards members earn 10 points per $1 spent on qualifying purchases. Plus, when members visit 12 times in a calendar month, they unlock Boosted Status, which means 20% more points earning (12 points per $1 spent) for a full 3 months after.
Redeeming your points:
Dunkin’ Rewards members can save their points and turn their points into rewards for free food and drinks! Rewards start at just 150 points, that’s only $15 spent!
Why did the program change?
Because our members deserve more! Dunkin' Rewards is designed to help keep you running all day long with the best that Dunkin' has to offer. You can now redeem your points on most menu items, including food and drinks.
How do I join Dunkin' Rewards?
Simply download the Dunkin’ app from your phone’s app store or enroll online at dunkindonuts.com. Remember, if you are already a DD Perks member, we will automatically enroll you in Dunkin’ Rewards.
Will I still get a free drink for my birthday?
Members that add their birthday to their account will be eligible for a birthday bonus! It's your ticket to an all-day bonus of 3X points on any purchases made. Members can choose to activate this offer the day before their birthday, the day of their birthday, or the day after their birthday.
Do my Dunkin' Rewards points expire?
Yes, points expire after 6 months if there has been no activity (meaning no Dunkin’ Reward point earning transaction) with an account.
Will I earn the same number of points regardless of how I pay?
Yes! Dunkin’ Rewards members can earn the same number of points regardless of how they pay — cash, credit/debit, enrolled Dunkin’ Gift Card, Apple Pay or Google Pay. Don’t forget to scan your Dunkin’ Rewards ID before paying in-store to earn your points.
Can I earn points in the drive-thru, through curbside pickup and in-store?
Members earn points when they scan their Dunkin’ Rewards ID, pay with an enrolled Dunkin’ Card or order ahead in the Dunkin' App at the drive-thru, with curbside pickup and in-store.
Can I earn points and redeem my rewards through Delivery?
No, Delivery orders currently are not eligible to earn points or to redeem rewards.
Do my reward coupons expire after I convert my points?
Yes, rewards expire 30 days from the day members convert their points into a reward.
Can I use more than 1 reward in a single transaction?
Yes! Dunkin’ Rewards members can redeem for more than 1 reward at a time. Be sure to read each reward’s description and terms for more information on redeeming.
What is Boosted Status and how do I earn it?
Dunkin' Rewards members receive Boosted Status after 12 qualifying visits in a calendar month, which unlocks 20% more points earning (for a total of 12 points per $1 spent) for a full 3 months after. And if members continue to visit 12 or more times every month, they’ll extend their Boosted Status for an additional month. Your visit tracker will reset to 0 at the start of each calendar month, no matter if you are Boosted or not.
What counts as a qualifying visit for Boosted Status?
A qualifying visit for Boosted Status must be at least 60 minutes apart and include the purchase of a points-eligible item. Redeeming a free reward does not count towards your Boosted Status visit count.
Where can I turn points into rewards?
Members can turn their points into rewards via the Dunkin’ App by selecting the Choose Rewards button once they have enough points for a reward category.
How do I redeem my rewards in Dunkin' Rewards?
Members can redeem their rewards via the Dunkin’ App, either in-store by scanning a reward's QR code at the register or in the app when they apply the reward in their cart before placing their mobile order.
Where can I keep track of my point earnings?
Your points and order history are available both in the Dunkin’ App and on your account on DunkinDonuts.com when you are signed in.
Where can I keep track of my rewards?
Your converted rewards will be displayed both in the Dunkin’ App and on your account on DunkinDonuts.com when you are signed in.
Which purchases do Dunkin' Rewards members earn points on?
Dunkin’ Rewards members earn points on all Dunkin' products purchased at participating locations,
except for the following
: the purchase or reload of Dunkin’ Gift Cards, Reward Coupon Redemptions, retail merchandise, Keurig Brewers, donations to charity, newspapers, products purchased on shopdunkin.com and other online platforms, and Baskin-Robbins products sold in Dunkin'/Baskin-Robbins® combo locations.
