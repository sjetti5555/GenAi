And if you win a promotion or sweepstakes, we will use identifiers to notify you.
Identifiers, demographic information, and inferences are used to administer our loyalty program.

We use the information we obtain for other purposes required by law.
For example, we may have tax or other reporting obligations or receive a request from a governmental entity.
We may combine information that we receive in-person with information we receive online, from third parties, and from our fellow brands (Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy John’s, and SONIC Drive-In).
How we disclose your information
We provide your information to others in the following ways:
We provide your information to our fellow brands.

We provide this information for processing your purchases of or requests for products and services, providing advertising and marketing services, short term and temporary uses like non-personalized advertising, auditing related to ad impressions, ensuring security and integrity of your personal information, debugging to identify and repair errors that prevent existing intended functionality of our services, and detecting, investigating, or protecting against wrongful, fraudulent, or otherwise illegal activity.

Franchise organizations are independent businesses, and their processing of personal information is subject to their own privacy policies.
We also provide your information to third parties.
When we provide your information to third parties, and they receive the data for their own purposes, the disclosure is considered a “sale” of personal information under some U.S. privacy laws. We do not sell your information for money. Your information we may “sell” includes identifiers, usage information, and transaction history. The categories of third parties we “sell” your personal information to include advertising partners, data analytics providers, social networks, affiliates, franchise organizations, and data brokers. We provide this information to show you relevant and personalized advertisements (targeted advertising) and for analytics, data strategy, consultation on, development or improvement of products and services, marketing, advertising, and related services.
We will provide your information when we are required by law or to protect ourselves.
We may provide your information to respond to a court order, subpoena, or government agency or investigatory body request. We may also provide your information to investigate potential fraud.

Cookies and other tracking technologies
Dunkin’ websites, apps, emails, and advertisements may use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags.
We also use tracking tools:
to recognize new visitors to our websites.
to recognize past customers.
to present more personalized content, to improve your website experience, optimize your shopping experience, and provide site and service enhancements.
to observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.
to better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.
We use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties to decide what content is relevant to you. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We or our partners might also look at your location. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others. We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.
Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop. Choices you make are both browser and device specific.
You may exercise choices to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
, by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at
https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb
, or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Most of the companies with whom we work to provide you with targeted ads support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance. This means that they allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across websites for online interest-based advertising purposes. More information can be found at www.aboutads.info/. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and other companies that participate in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices, or
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices
. An “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements. Opt-out Cookies only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt-out of interest-based advertisements across all of your browsers and devices, you will need to opt-out on each browser on each device you actively use. If you delete Cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your mobile apps, please follow the instructions at
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
. Please note that when you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our website or mobile application. It means that the online ads that you do see from participants should not be based on your particular interests. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any other entity’s opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, other entities may still use tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other permitted purpose.

You have the right to opt out of these sales and can do so

Loyalty Program and Financial Incentive Disclosures
We may offer loyalty programs (including Dunkin’ Rewards) that provide benefits such as rewards points and discounts to those who participate.

Participation requires you to provide some personal information, such as identifiers, demographic information (age), usage information, and transaction history. The incentives associated with our loyalty programs are designed to reward loyal customers for continuing to purchase our products. For terms and conditions applicable to our loyalty programs, including Dunkin’ Rewards, please see our
Terms of Use
. For terms and conditions specific to Dunkin’ Rewards, please see our
Dunkin’ Rewards Terms
. We have made a good faith estimate that the value of the personal information provided in connection with our loyalty programs is roughly equivalent to the relevant expenses related to the collection and retention of that personal information. Any difference in price or benefits provided to customers who participate in our loyalty programs is reasonably related to the value of personal information provided.
