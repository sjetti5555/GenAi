CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY
IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT
California Transparency in Supply Chains
We are dedicated to conducting business in compliance with all laws, regulations and ethics of fairness and human decency, both nationally and internationally. We seek to use suppliers who share our commitments, and agree to abide by our supplier code of conduct.
We screen suppliers on many business related criteria as well as their compliance with matters of law.  We seek partners that comply with government regulations, including those concerning human ethics.  Our suppliers are required to acknowledge, and agree to, our Supplier Code of Conduct.
We conduct periodic on-site, announced and unannounced, visits to our manufacturing and distribution facilities around the globe, during which our employees, third party auditors and other designated associates inspect facilities and observe conditions, workers and practices as well as the suppliers compliance with our supplier Quality management systems, supplier Code of Conduct or contract terms, as applicable.
We maintain accountability standards, including a Code of Conduct for our employees and a supplier Code of Conduct for our suppliers.  If we determine that our employees or suppliers are engaged in slavery or human trafficking, our employees will be disciplined, up to and including termination, and our supplier relationships terminated.
All of our employees who are involved in supplier management are trained annually on administering our supplier Code of Conduct.  In addition, all employees participate in an annual employee Code of Conduct training.
