,"[00:00] The top 10 things to know about quadratics
- Quadratic relationships can be recognized from equations, tables, and graphs
- Quadratic relationships have a degree 2 polynomial equation and form a parabola shape
- All parabolas have a vertex and are symmetrical about a vertical axis
- The standard form equation of a quadratic is y=ax^2+bx+c
- From the standard form equation, we can determine properties of the quadratic relationship

[] Understanding the basics of quadratic equations in standard and vertex form
- Standard form equation: a determines direction of opening, C reveals Y-intercept
- Table of values can be used to graph standard form equations
- Vertex form equation: H and K values determine vertex coordinates, a determines direction of opening
- Converting standard form to vertex form can help find vertex of Parabola

[] The video explains the three forms of quadratic equations and their significance in solving and graphing quadratic functions.
- The standard form is ax^2 + bx + c and can be used to find the vertex, axis of symmetry, and intercepts
- The vertex form is a(x-h)^2 + k and can be used to find the vertex and axis of symmetry
- The factored form is a(x-m)(x-n) and can be used to find the x-intercepts

[] Factored form basics of quadratics: finding X-intercepts, axis of symmetry, and vertex
- X-intercepts can be found by setting Y to zero and using the zero product rule
- Axis of symmetry is the average of X-intercepts
- Vertex falls on the axis of symmetry and can be found by substituting the X-coordinate into the factored form equation
- Quadratics with leading coefficient of one can be factored using product and sum method

[] Learn how to factor and solve quadratic equations using factoring, including the difference of squares rule.

[] The video explains how to solve quadratic equations by factoring and completing the square
- To factor a quadratic, find numbers that multiply to C and add to B, then use the zero product rule to find the roots
- If factoring is not possible, convert the quadratic to vertex form by completing the square, then rearrange to isolate X

[] Learn how to solve quadratic equations using completing the square and the quadratic formula.
- Completing the square involves rearranging the equation to isolate X
- Quadratic formula is x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
- Quadratic formula can be used to find solutions without completing the square
- Example: x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0 can be solved using quadratic formula to get x = 3 ± sqrt(17)

[] Quadratic formula and discriminant determine the number and type of solutions to a quadratic equation
- Discriminant is the part under the square root in quadratic formula
- If discriminant is greater than zero, there are two real solutions
- If discriminant is equal to zero, there is only one real solution
- If discriminant is less than zero, there are no real solutions
- If discriminant is a perfect square, the quadratic is factorable

[] The video explains three ways to find the vertex of a parabola in standard form
- Completing the square method involves factoring and adding/subtracting a constant
- Finding X-intercepts and averaging them gives the X-coordinate of the vertex
- Using the formula B/2A gives the X-coordinate, which can be used to find the Y-coordinate",0.05606060606060606,positive

,"Method 1) 
(- x= 3) equation is given 
Multiplying both sides by (-1)
 -1*-x=-1*3
Then x=-3
or 

Method 2) 
Let the equation be (- x= 3)

 If we multiply both sides with ""MINUS"" sign 
-(- x)= -(3) 
Then x= -3.
 Which one is correct or both methods are correct .
