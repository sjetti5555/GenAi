FAQS

Items
How is Dunkin' Rewards different from DD Perks?
Dunkin’ Rewards is our new rewards program, replacing DD Perks. The major differences are:
Earning points:
Dunkin’ Rewards members earn 10 points per $1 spent on qualifying purchases. Plus, when members visit 12 times in a calendar month, they unlock Boosted Status, which means 20% more points earning (12 points per $1 spent) for a full 3 months after.
Redeeming your points:
Dunkin’ Rewards members can save their points and turn their points into rewards for free food and drinks! Rewards start at just 150 points, that’s only $15 spent!
Why did the program change?
Because our members deserve more! Dunkin' Rewards is designed to help keep you running all day long with the best that Dunkin' has to offer. You can now redeem your points on most menu items, including food and drinks.
How do I join Dunkin' Rewards?
Simply download the Dunkin’ app from your phone’s app store or enroll online at dunkindonuts.com. Remember, if you are already a DD Perks member, we will automatically enroll you in Dunkin’ Rewards.
Will I still get a free drink for my birthday?
Members that add their birthday to their account will be eligible for a birthday bonus! It's your ticket to an all-day bonus of 3X points on any purchases made. Members can choose to activate this offer the day before their birthday, the day of their birthday, or the day after their birthday.
Do my Dunkin' Rewards points expire?
Yes, points expire after 6 months if there has been no activity (meaning no Dunkin’ Reward point earning transaction) with an account.
Will I earn the same number of points regardless of how I pay?
Yes! Dunkin’ Rewards members can earn the same number of points regardless of how they pay — cash, credit/debit, enrolled Dunkin’ Gift Card, Apple Pay or Google Pay. Don’t forget to scan your Dunkin’ Rewards ID before paying in-store to earn your points.
Can I earn points in the drive-thru, through curbside pickup and in-store?
Members earn points when they scan their Dunkin’ Rewards ID, pay with an enrolled Dunkin’ Card or order ahead in the Dunkin' App at the drive-thru, with curbside pickup and in-store.
Can I earn points and redeem my rewards through Delivery?
No, Delivery orders currently are not eligible to earn points or to redeem rewards.
Do my reward coupons expire after I convert my points?
Yes, rewards expire 30 days from the day members convert their points into a reward.
Can I use more than 1 reward in a single transaction?
Yes! Dunkin’ Rewards members can redeem for more than 1 reward at a time. Be sure to read each reward’s description and terms for more information on redeeming.
What is Boosted Status and how do I earn it?
Dunkin' Rewards members receive Boosted Status after 12 qualifying visits in a calendar month, which unlocks 20% more points earning (for a total of 12 points per $1 spent) for a full 3 months after. And if members continue to visit 12 or more times every month, they’ll extend their Boosted Status for an additional month. Your visit tracker will reset to 0 at the start of each calendar month, no matter if you are Boosted or not.
What counts as a qualifying visit for Boosted Status?
A qualifying visit for Boosted Status must be at least 60 minutes apart and include the purchase of a points-eligible item. Redeeming a free reward does not count towards your Boosted Status visit count.
Where can I turn points into rewards?
Members can turn their points into rewards via the Dunkin’ App by selecting the Choose Rewards button once they have enough points for a reward category.
How do I redeem my rewards in Dunkin' Rewards?
Members can redeem their rewards via the Dunkin’ App, either in-store by scanning a reward's QR code at the register or in the app when they apply the reward in their cart before placing their mobile order.
Where can I keep track of my point earnings?
Your points and order history are available both in the Dunkin’ App and on your account on DunkinDonuts.com when you are signed in.
Where can I keep track of my rewards?
Your converted rewards will be displayed both in the Dunkin’ App and on your account on DunkinDonuts.com when you are signed in.
Which purchases do Dunkin' Rewards members earn points on?
Dunkin’ Rewards members earn points on all Dunkin' products purchased at participating locations,
except for the following
: the purchase or reload of Dunkin’ Gift Cards, Reward Coupon Redemptions, retail merchandise, Keurig Brewers, donations to charity, newspapers, products purchased on shopdunkin.com and other online platforms, and Baskin-Robbins products sold in Dunkin'/Baskin-Robbins® combo locations.

Where can I find Dunkin’s nutrition information?
Our full product
nutritional and allergen information
is available in PDF form on the DunkinDonuts.com website.
You can also view an individual product’s allergen and ingredient information by exploring our
menu
on the DunkinDonuts.com website.
Can I get Cold Brew or Frozen Coffee in Decaf?
Unfortunately, our Cold Brew and Frozen Coffee are not available in Decaf.
Should I store my coffee in the refrigerator or freezer?
We do not recommend keeping our coffee in the refrigerator or freezer. Coffee is similar to baking soda in the way it can absorb moisture and aromas. It is also best if coffee is not exposed to light. We suggest you store your Dunkin' coffee in an airtight, opaque container in a cool, dark place to maintain optimum flavor and freshness.
Guest Satisfaction Survey
NEW Guest Satisfaction Survey - Redemption Rules on DD.com
Thank you for completing our Guest Satisfaction Survey! To claim your free classic donut with the purchase of a medium or larger Dunkin’ beverage, bring the coupon or offer code that was provided at the end of the survey to a participating Dunkin’ location.
Offer not valid on Mobile App orders. Limit one coupon per customer per visit. Coupon or offer code must be presented at time of order. Good for one free classic donut with the purchase of a medium or larger Dunkin’ beverage (excludes cooler beverages). No substitutions allowed. No cash refunds. Void if copied or transferred and where prohibited or restricted by law. Consumer must pay applicable tax. May not be combined with any other coupon, discount, or promotion, and is limited to one-time use. Coupon may not be reproduced, copied, purchased, traded, or sold. Internet distribution or resale strictly prohibited. Cash redemption value 1/20 of 1 cent. Coupon or offer code expires
14 days
from date of issue. Good at participating U.S. Dunkin’ locations only.
Corporate Sponsorships & Donations
Does Dunkin' provide corporate sponsorships or donations?
Dunkin' does not accept unsolicited requests for corporate sponsorships or donations, including product donations. Dunkin’ supports a targeted group of non-profit organizations within three focus areas: hunger relief, safety, and children’s health. We believe we can make the greatest impact in our communities by focusing our resources on these organizations. Thank you for thinking of Dunkin' and for working to support our communities.
Do local Dunkin' stores provide sponsorships or donations?
If you are seeking sponsorship or a donation from your local Dunkin', it is best to speak directly with the owner. We suggest providing franchise owners at least 3 weeks’ notice. Please keep in mind, due to the volume of requests our local franchise owners receive, they cannot honor all requests.
Employment, Vendors, & Franchising
How can I apply to work at a Dunkin’?
We are excited to hear you want to work for Dunkin’. Our restaurants are individually owned and operated. We suggest visiting our
Careers
page or contacting your local restaurant for further information on employment opportunities.
Where do I get information on franchises or franchise opportunities?
Find all the information you need related to franchises and franchise opportunities on our dedicated website:
DunkinFranchising.com
or contact 1-800-777-9983 with specific inquiries.
How do I suggest a site for development?
If you want to suggest a site for development, please email the complete site details, including your contact information, to development_sites@dunkinbrands.com.
If your site meets our current development objectives, one of our Field Executives will contact you directly to discuss next steps.
How can I become a vendor for Dunkin'?
If you are interested in establishing a business relationship with Dunkin', send your written information and contact information via U.S. mail to:
Inspire Brands-Boston Support Center
Attn: Vendor Relations
130 Royall Street
Canton, MA 02021
Your information will be forwarded for review. If we’re interested or if additional information is required, someone will contact you. Please note that our internal policies prevent us from giving out directory information.
Catering
Does Dunkin’ offer catering?
We don’t currently have a national catering menu, but we recommend contacting your local Dunkin’ locations to see if they can support your request. Search for your nearest Dunkin’ location

Items
How is Dunkin' Rewards different from DD Perks?
Dunkin’ Rewards is our new rewards program, replacing DD Perks. The major differences are:
Earning points:
Dunkin’ Rewards members earn 10 points per $1 spent on qualifying purchases. Plus, when members visit 12 times in a calendar month, they unlock Boosted Status, which means 20% more points earning (12 points per $1 spent) for a full 3 months after.
Redeeming your points:
Dunkin’ Rewards members can save their points and turn their points into rewards for free food and drinks! Rewards start at just 150 points, that’s only $15 spent!
Why did the program change?
Because our members deserve more! Dunkin' Rewards is designed to help keep you running all day long with the best that Dunkin' has to offer. You can now redeem your points on most menu items, including food and drinks.
How do I join Dunkin' Rewards?
Simply download the Dunkin’ app from your phone’s app store or enroll online at dunkindonuts.com. Remember, if you are already a DD Perks member, we will automatically enroll you in Dunkin’ Rewards.
Will I still get a free drink for my birthday?
Members that add their birthday to their account will be eligible for a birthday bonus! It's your ticket to an all-day bonus of 3X points on any purchases made. Members can choose to activate this offer the day before their birthday, the day of their birthday, or the day after their birthday.
Do my Dunkin' Rewards points expire?
Yes, points expire after 6 months if there has been no activity (meaning no Dunkin’ Reward point earning transaction) with an account.
Will I earn the same number of points regardless of how I pay?
Yes! Dunkin’ Rewards members can earn the same number of points regardless of how they pay — cash, credit/debit, enrolled Dunkin’ Gift Card, Apple Pay or Google Pay. Don’t forget to scan your Dunkin’ Rewards ID before paying in-store to earn your points.
Can I earn points in the drive-thru, through curbside pickup and in-store?
Members earn points when they scan their Dunkin’ Rewards ID, pay with an enrolled Dunkin’ Card or order ahead in the Dunkin' App at the drive-thru, with curbside pickup and in-store.
Can I earn points and redeem my rewards through Delivery?
No, Delivery orders currently are not eligible to earn points or to redeem rewards.
Do my reward coupons expire after I convert my points?
Yes, rewards expire 30 days from the day members convert their points into a reward.
Can I use more than 1 reward in a single transaction?
Yes! Dunkin’ Rewards members can redeem for more than 1 reward at a time. Be sure to read each reward’s description and terms for more information on redeeming.
What is Boosted Status and how do I earn it?
Dunkin' Rewards members receive Boosted Status after 12 qualifying visits in a calendar month, which unlocks 20% more points earning (for a total of 12 points per $1 spent) for a full 3 months after. And if members continue to visit 12 or more times every month, they’ll extend their Boosted Status for an additional month. Your visit tracker will reset to 0 at the start of each calendar month, no matter if you are Boosted or not.
What counts as a qualifying visit for Boosted Status?
A qualifying visit for Boosted Status must be at least 60 minutes apart and include the purchase of a points-eligible item. Redeeming a free reward does not count towards your Boosted Status visit count.
Where can I turn points into rewards?
Members can turn their points into rewards via the Dunkin’ App by selecting the Choose Rewards button once they have enough points for a reward category.
How do I redeem my rewards in Dunkin' Rewards?
Members can redeem their rewards via the Dunkin’ App, either in-store by scanning a reward's QR code at the register or in the app when they apply the reward in their cart before placing their mobile order.
Where can I keep track of my point earnings?
Your points and order history are available both in the Dunkin’ App and on your account on DunkinDonuts.com when you are signed in.
Where can I keep track of my rewards?
Your converted rewards will be displayed both in the Dunkin’ App and on your account on DunkinDonuts.com when you are signed in.
Which purchases do Dunkin' Rewards members earn points on?
Dunkin’ Rewards members earn points on all Dunkin' products purchased at participating locations,
except for the following
: the purchase or reload of Dunkin’ Gift Cards, Reward Coupon Redemptions, retail merchandise, Keurig Brewers, donations to charity, newspapers, products purchased on shopdunkin.com and other online platforms, and Baskin-Robbins products sold in Dunkin'/Baskin-Robbins® combo locations.
Why am I being asked to prove I’m a human (not a bot)?
Dunkin’ has partnered with HUMAN security to keep our app and web as safe for our users as possible. This means that occasionally, some users will be presented with a challenge in order to continue their session.

; or in the Dunkin’ app. You can also purchase a Dunkin' Card through your existing account if you have a Dunkin’ Account or Dunkin' Rewards account.
For additional ways to purchase a Dunkin' Card, visit our
Get a Dunkin' Card
page.
Note: Dunkin' Cards purchased in the Dunkin’ app are virtual cards and usable only from within the Dunkin’ App. You will not receive a physical card.
Can I purchase and/or reload a Dunkin' Card with another Dunkin' Card?
No. Dunkin' Cards can be only be purchased and/or reloaded using cash, credit card, or debit card.
Are there any fees associated with my Dunkin' Card?
Never! Dunkin' Cards are free to use and you will never be charged a service fee for having a balance.
Registering a Card & Dunkin' Rewards
Do I need to register my Dunkin' Card in order to use it?
You do not need to register your Dunkin' Card to use it. However, we encourage you to
register your Dunkin' Card
to earn points and to protect your balance in case your card is lost.
Where do I find the 16-digit card number and PIN?
Your 16-digit card number and PIN is located on the back of your physical Dunkin' Cards. Your PIN may be covered by a scratch-off sticker.
Why does the back of my Dunkin' Card have a scratch-off sticker with a number beneath it?
The number beneath the scratch-off sticker is your Personal Identification Number (PIN) or ID Number (ID). You will need this PIN/ID# to check your balance and transaction history, register your card, reload your card, and set up auto-reload on your card at
DunkinDonuts.com
. If your card does not have a PIN/ID# on the back, please contact the Loyalty Support Team at 1-800-447-0013.
Card Balance
How do I check my Dunkin' Card balance?
You can
check your Dunkin’ Card balance
on the DunkinDonuts.com website using your Card # and PIN.
You can also check your Dunkin’ Card balance by calling (800) 447-0013 and selecting Option 2.
If you are a rewards member, you can check the balance of any registered Dunkin’ Cards by signing in to your account in the Dunkin’ app or on DunkinDonuts.com. If using the app, sign in and select ‘Add/Manage Cards’ from the main menu. If using the website, sign in and select ‘Check Balance and Funds’ from the menu in the top right-hand corner.
My balance doesn’t seem to reflect what my receipt says. How can I confirm my current balance?
If your card balance does not update immediately after a transaction, you can manually refresh it. We recommend that you refresh your balance regularly.
On the Dunkin' app, go to the “Add/Manage Cards” tab. Select a card, and tap the refresh button (the pink arrow in a circle) next to your card balance to refersh it.
On
DunkinDonuts.com
, go to the “Check Balance & Funds” tab. Under your card balance, click the refresh button (the pink box with two arrows in a circle).
I have cards with $0.00 balances. Is there a way to delete my old cards?
You can no longer remove gift cards from your account on
DunkinDonuts.com
. You can, however, remove gift cards with $0.00 balances from the Dunkin' app. On the Dunkin' app, go to the "Add/Manage Cards" tab. Select a card and then tap "Delete".
Is there a way to combine all my cards to my primary card?
Yes! You can now merge gift card balances through the Dunkin' App and
DunkinDonuts.com
. If you have more than one card on your account, please follow the steps below to merge the balances onto one card:
Mobile App:
Navigate to "Add/Manage Cards.”
Scroll to “My Additional Cards,” and select the card you want to merge to your primary balance.
Tap “Merge Balance to Primary” and tap “Confirm.”
DunkinDonuts.com:
Navigate to the "Transfer Funds" screen.
Click on the drop-down menu below “Transfer to” to select the card to which you want the funds transferred.
Under “Transfer From,” select the card from which you would like the balance transferred.
Click "Review,” then click “Confirm” to complete the transfer.
Please Note: Once your card is successfully merged, a confirmation will appear on the screen. Any cards that you merge "from" will be unregistered and removed from your account.
Where can I view my order history?
If you are registered in our
Dunkin' Rewards
program, you can view your order history in the Dunkin’ App or on our website under transaction history.
Can I receive cash back for the remaining balance on my card?
Dunkin' Card balances cannot be redeemed for cash, check or credit—unless required by law.
Reloading a Dunkin' Card
Once I set up Auto-Reload for my Dunkin' Card, when should I expect the reload to occur?
If you set up a “By Schedule” Auto-Reload, the transaction will usually occur by 12:00 PM ET on the day you set up Auto- Reload. If you set up a “By Balance” Auto-Reload, the transaction will usually occur by 12:00 PM ET on the day after your balance falls below your set minimum.
Why can't I reload my Dunkin' Card?
If you are having trouble reloading your Dunkin’ Card, please delete and re-upload the credit or debit card on your account, ensuring that all the information matches what your bank has on file (including name, number, and address). If you continue to receive an error, please note the error number and give us a call at (800) 447-0013, Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. ET.
Payments & Billing
What are your accepted forms of payment?
DunkinDonuts.com
currently accepts American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.
Is it really safe to use my credit card to order from Dunkin'?
Yes. We use a sophisticated software program (Secure Socket Layer Technology or SSL) that encrypts all information before it's sent to us. If anyone does intercept data, they won't be able to read or use it. In addition, all payment info is stored within your account—never on your device.
Dunkin' is committed to keeping your personal information confidential. For more information, please see our
Privacy Policy
.
Can I store multiple forms of payment to purchase or reload my Dunkin' cards?
Of course! You can manage your cards within your account on DunkinDonuts.com or in the Dunkin’ app. Note: logging in to the app with your Dunkin' account will sync the two.
How do I update my credit card information?
To edit the credit card information on your account, please follow the instructions below:
Mobile App:
Navigate to "My Account" and select "Payment Details."
To add a new credit card, select "Add Credit/Debit Card."
To edit or delete an existing card, select that card and make any changes on the following screen.
DunkinDonuts.com
Navigate to "Manage Profile" and select "Payment Methods."
Click edit or delete to either modify or remove a card from your account.
To add a new credit card, navigate to "Check Balance & Add Value" screen and click "Add Credit Card."
Lost Cards
What if my Card is lost?
Email us
and we’ll freeze your balance, transfer it, and mail it your way. If your card is not registered, you must treat your card like cash. We cannot replace it if it is lost or stolen.

California Transparency in Supply Chains
We are dedicated to conducting business in compliance with all laws, regulations and ethics of fairness and human decency, both nationally and internationally. We seek to use suppliers who share our commitments, and agree to abide by our supplier code of conduct.
We screen suppliers on many business related criteria as well as their compliance with matters of law.  We seek partners that comply with government regulations, including those concerning human ethics.  Our suppliers are required to acknowledge, and agree to, our Supplier Code of Conduct.
We conduct periodic on-site, announced and unannounced, visits to our manufacturing and distribution facilities around the globe, during which our employees, third party auditors and other designated associates inspect facilities and observe conditions, workers and practices as well as the suppliers compliance with our supplier Quality management systems, supplier Code of Conduct or contract terms, as applicable.
We maintain accountability standards, including a Code of Conduct for our employees and a supplier Code of Conduct for our suppliers.  If we determine that our employees or suppliers are engaged in slavery or human trafficking, our employees will be disciplined, up to and including termination, and our supplier relationships terminated.
All of our employees who are involved in supplier management are trained annually on administering our supplier Code of Conduct.  In addition, all employees participate in an annual employee Code of Conduct training.

For questions or requests related to your privacy, please contact your franchise organization.
How we gather your information
We collect information in the following ways:
From you.
We collect identifiers, demographic information, payment information, transaction history, account log-in, location or precise location, and professional information directly from you. When you purchase from our stores in-person, on our website, or in our app, we collect identifiers, payment information, and transaction history.

If you grant us permission on your device, we will collect your location or precise location. If you complete a survey, we may collect demographic data, including protected classifications, and professional information.

How we use your information
We use personal data to communicate with you, provide our loyalty program when you join, process your orders, customize our offerings, protect our business, provide a personalized experience to you, and as otherwise required by law. For most purposes, we rely on your consent or the necessity to fulfill a contract to process your personal information; however, we may also process your personal information to comply with the law, protect your or another’s vital interests, or where we believe it is in our or another’s legitimate interests after considering your interests, rights, and expectations.
Identifiers are used to communicate with you.
Identifiers are used to respond to your inquiries, communicate with you about our terms and policies, and send you our newsletter if you have signed up. We may also send you marketing through text, email, our app, or social media, such as special offers, new products or features, and information about Dunkin’ or our fellow brands. And if you win a promotion or sweepstakes, we will use identifiers to notify you.
Identifiers, demographic information, and inferences are used to administer our loyalty program.
You can find more information about our loyalty program at
Loyalty Program and Financial Incentive Disclosures.

We use identifiers, usage information, demographic information, payment information, and transaction history to protect our company and its stakeholders (including you), for example by securing our systems, identifying fraud, and detecting fraudulent credit card purchases.
We use the information we obtain for other purposes required by law.
For example, we may have tax or other reporting obligations or receive a request from a governmental entity.
We may combine information that we receive in-person with information we receive online, from third parties, and from our fellow brands (Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy John’s, and SONIC Drive-In).
How we disclose your information
We provide your information to others in the following ways:
We provide your information to our fellow brands.
We disclose identifiers, payment information, transaction history, demographic information, usage information, and inferences with the multi-brand restaurant company Inspire Brands and our fellow brands within the Inspire family (Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy John’s, and SONIC Drive-In), and any future fellow brands. We provide this information for processing your purchases of or requests for products and services, providing advertising and marketing services, short term and temporary uses like non-personalized advertising, auditing related to ad impressions, ensuring security and integrity of your personal information, debugging to identify and repair errors that prevent existing intended functionality of our services, and detecting, investigating, or protecting against wrongful, fraudulent, or otherwise illegal activity.

We share identifiers, payment information, transaction history, demographic information, usage information, location, precise location, and inferences with service providers for fulfilling and delivering orders, helping you find one of our restaurants, processing payments, supporting our promotions, contests, gift cards, or loyalty programs, and providing communications, technical, analytical, web hosting, cloud hosting, and mobile application support, and other services on our behalf. We provide this information for processing your purchases of or requests for products and services, providing advertising and marketing services, short term and temporary uses like non-personalized advertising, auditing related to ad impressions, ensuring security and integrity of your personal information, debugging to identify and repair errors that prevent existing intended functionality of our services, and detecting, investigating, or protecting against wrongful, fraudulent, or otherwise illegal activity.
We provide your information to franchisees.
We provide identifiers, payment information, transaction history, usage information, demographic information, and location information to franchise organizations.

Franchise organizations are independent businesses, and their processing of personal information is subject to their own privacy policies.
We also provide your information to third parties.
When we provide your information to third parties, and they receive the data for their own purposes, the disclosure is considered a “sale” of personal information under some U.S. privacy laws. We do not sell your information for money. Your information we may “sell” includes identifiers, usage information, and transaction history. The categories of third parties we “sell” your personal information to include advertising partners, data analytics providers, social networks, affiliates, franchise organizations, and data brokers. We provide this information to show you relevant and personalized advertisements (targeted advertising) and for analytics, data strategy, consultation on, development or improvement of products and services, marketing, advertising, and related services.
We will provide your information when we are required by law or to protect ourselves.
We may provide your information to respond to a court order, subpoena, or government agency or investigatory body request. We may also provide your information to investigate potential fraud.
We will provide your information in connection with business combination or similar corporate reorganization.
We will disclose your information in connection with any actual or proposed corporate reorganization, merger, sale, or other acquisition or business combination. We will disclose your information in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings.
We may otherwise provide your information as permitted by law.
Cookies and other tracking technologies
Dunkin’ websites, apps, emails, and advertisements may use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags.
We also use tracking tools:
to recognize new visitors to our websites.
to recognize past customers.
to present more personalized content, to improve your website experience, optimize your shopping experience, and provide site and service enhancements.
to observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.
to better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.
We use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties to decide what content is relevant to you. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We or our partners might also look at your location. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others. We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.
Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop. Choices you make are both browser and device specific.
You may exercise choices to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
, by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at
https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb
, or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Most of the companies with whom we work to provide you with targeted ads support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance. This means that they allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across websites for online interest-based advertising purposes. More information can be found at www.aboutads.info/. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and other companies that participate in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices, or
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices
. An “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements. Opt-out Cookies only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt-out of interest-based advertisements across all of your browsers and devices, you will need to opt-out on each browser on each device you actively use. If you delete Cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your mobile apps, please follow the instructions at
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
. Please note that when you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our website or mobile application. It means that the online ads that you do see from participants should not be based on your particular interests. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any other entity’s opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, other entities may still use tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other permitted purpose.
Your privacy rights
You have choices related to your personal information, and these rights may have different names under different laws.
You have the right to:
Access your Personal Data.
You have the right to confirm whether we are processing your personal information and receive a copy of that information. You can request this information
here
.
Correct.
You can correct your inaccurate information. This is generally completed by updating your account information.
Delete.
If you don’t want us to have your information, we don’t want to have it. You can ask us to erase your information
here
, but we may maintain some information for security, fraud prevention, auditing purposes or to comply with a legal obligation or governmental request.
Opt Out of Sales.
Some state laws define “sales” of personal information as the exchange of personal information for any valuable consideration (such as services). We do not sell your data in exchange for money. We do “sell” your personal information when we provide your personal information to another business, and they use it for their own purposes. You have the right to opt out of these sales and can do so
here
.
Opt Out of Targeted Advertising.
We use targeted advertising to present offers we think you may be interested in. You have the right to opt out of targeted advertising and can do so
here
.
You can exercise your rights
here
. If you have an account, requests to correct inaccurate information must generally be completed through your Account Settings on our website or app. You can also call us at 1-800-859-5339. We will need to verify your identity for security and fraud prevention purposes by phone or email.
You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia provide a formal right to appeal if we decline to take action on your request. No matter your location, you can appeal such a decision by emailing us at
customerservice@dunkinbrands.com
. We will respond to your appeal within 45 days of receiving the appeal. If we deny your appeal and you are located in Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, or Virginia, you can contact your Attorney General to submit a complaint.
You may also have rights that do not apply to us because we do not use your personal information for those purposes, such as the right to opt out of certain profiling and the right to limit the use of your sensitive personal information.
We have disclosure obligations in Nevada. A “sale” under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for money for a third party to license or sell to other third parties. We do not “sell” personal information as defined under Nevada law. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us at
customerservice@dunkinbrands.com
and include the words “Nevada Rights” in the subject line.

Your personal information is needed to carry out a purpose that is compatible with the purposed stated when initially collected;
Your personal information is reasonably required for us to protect or defend our rights or property; or
We are otherwise required or permitted by law to keep your information.

Children’s data
Our sites and apps are meant to be used by adults. We do not want to have any data concerning children under the age of 16 and do not knowingly collect, sell, or share personal information of children under the age of 16. If you are under the age of 16, please do not provide us with any personal information. If you think we have been provided with the personal information of a child under the age of 16, please let us know (you can contact us using the information in the “Contact us” section immediately above). We encourage parents to teach their children to never provide personal information online.
California Privacy Disclosures
Below you will find specific disclosures required for our California consumers. We treat our guests equally, and you can use these disclosures no matter the state you reside in. Our Privacy Policy includes information on the categories of personal information we collect (
Information we collect
), categories of sources from whom we collect that information (
How we gather that information
), the purpose for collection (
How we use that information
), and categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties and the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed that personal information and categories of personal information sold or shared, including the categories of third parties we sold to or shared with and the purpose for selling or sharing (
How we provide that information to others
). We use and disclose sensitive personal information to provide you with services requested (i.e. using opted-in precise geolocation to notify you of deals at local stores or deliver ordered food). We do not collect or use sensitive personal information for the purpose of understanding characteristics about you. We do not want to have any data concerning those under the age of 16 and do not have knowledge of selling or sharing such information.
California privacy rights
California consumers have the right to know, access, correct, and delete their personal information. California consumers also have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information. California consumers have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights. If you have an account, you can correct your account information within your account settings. Some corrections may not be available at this time. You can submit a request to exercise your rights
here
. We will need to verify your identity by phone or email for security and fraud prevention purposes. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf; however, you may still need to verify your identity directly before your request can be processed. Your authorized agent may submit a request on your behalf using the webform or toll-free number listed above.
Loyalty Program and Financial Incentive Disclosures
We may offer loyalty programs (including Dunkin’ Rewards) that provide benefits such as rewards points and discounts to those who participate. From time to time, we also offer coupons, discount codes, or offers for free products that require a sign-up. Participation requires you to provide some personal information, such as identifiers, demographic information (age), usage information, and transaction history. The incentives associated with our loyalty programs are designed to reward loyal customers for continuing to purchase our products. For terms and conditions applicable to our loyalty programs, including Dunkin’ Rewards, please see our
Terms of Use
. For terms and conditions specific to Dunkin’ Rewards, please see our
Dunkin’ Rewards Terms
. We have made a good faith estimate that the value of the personal information provided in connection with our loyalty programs is roughly equivalent to the relevant expenses related to the collection and retention of that personal information. Any difference in price or benefits provided to customers who participate in our loyalty programs is reasonably related to the value of personal information provided. By joining our loyalty program, you consent to any financial incentive associated with the program.

How we gather your information
We collect information in the following ways:
From you.
We collect identifiers, demographic information, payment information, transaction history, account log-in, location or precise location, and professional information directly from you. When you purchase from our stores in-person, on our website, or in our app, we collect identifiers, payment information, and transaction history.

If you grant us permission on your device, we will collect your location or precise location. If you complete a survey, we may collect demographic data, including protected classifications, and professional information.
From tracking technologies (like cookies).
We collect usage information and demographic information through tracking technologies like cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags on our website or in emails we send. Third parties also collect usage information on our behalf when you use our website or apps.
From third parties.
We collect identifiers, demographic information, professional information, usage information, and protected classifications from our fellow brands (Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy John’s, and SONIC Drive-In), service providers, social media platforms, and third parties. Categories of service providers and third parties include advertising networks, data analytics providers, data brokers, and other vendors that provide order delivery, payment processing, promotions, contests, gift cards, loyalty program, sweepstakes, communications, marketing, and other services.
We create inferences ourselves and collect inferences from data analytics providers.
How we use your information
We use personal data to communicate with you, provide our loyalty program when you join, process your orders, customize our offerings, protect our business, provide a personalized experience to you, and as otherwise required by law. For most purposes, we rely on your consent or the necessity to fulfill a contract to process your personal information; however, we may also process your personal information to comply with the law, protect your or another’s vital interests, or where we believe it is in our or another’s legitimate interests after considering your interests, rights, and expectations.
Identifiers are used to communicate with you.
Identifiers are used to respond to your inquiries, communicate with you about our terms and policies, and send you our newsletter if you have signed up. We may also send you marketing through text, email, our app, or social media, such as special offers, new products or features, and information about Dunkin’ or our fellow brands. And if you win a promotion or sweepstakes, we will use identifiers to notify you.
Identifiers, demographic information, and inferences are used to administer our loyalty program.
You can find more information about our loyalty program at
Loyalty Program and Financial Incentive Disclosures.
Identifiers, payment information, and location or precise location are used to process your orders.
Identifiers and payment information are used to process payments and deliver orders. Location or precise location may be used when you have granted that permission on your device.
Identifiers, usage, demographic, and payment information, transaction history, location or precise location, and inferences are used to improve and customize our offerings.
Identifiers, payment information, usage information, demographic information, transaction history, location or precise location, and inferences are used to improve our website, app, services, and products. This includes customizing your experience with us and market research.
Identifiers, usage, demographic, and payment information, and transaction history are used to protect us, our stakeholders, and you.
We use identifiers, usage information, demographic information, payment information, and transaction history to protect our company and its stakeholders (including you), for example by securing our systems, identifying fraud, and detecting fraudulent credit card purchases.
We use the information we obtain for other purposes required by law.
For example, we may have tax or other reporting obligations or receive a request from a governmental entity.
We may combine information that we receive in-person with information we receive online, from third parties, and from our fellow brands (Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy John’s, and SONIC Drive-In).
How we disclose your information
We provide your information to others in the following ways:
We provide your information to our fellow brands.
We disclose identifiers, payment information, transaction history, demographic information, usage information, and inferences with the multi-brand restaurant company Inspire Brands and our fellow brands within the Inspire family (Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy John’s, and SONIC Drive-In), and any future fellow brands. We provide this information for processing your purchases of or requests for products and services, providing advertising and marketing services, short term and temporary uses like non-personalized advertising, auditing related to ad impressions, ensuring security and integrity of your personal information, debugging to identify and repair errors that prevent existing intended functionality of our services, and detecting, investigating, or protecting against wrongful, fraudulent, or otherwise illegal activity.
We provide your information to service providers.
We share identifiers, payment information, transaction history, demographic information, usage information, location, precise location, and inferences with service providers for fulfilling and delivering orders, helping you find one of our restaurants, processing payments, supporting our promotions, contests, gift cards, or loyalty programs, and providing communications, technical, analytical, web hosting, cloud hosting, and mobile application support, and other services on our behalf. We provide this information for processing your purchases of or requests for products and services, providing advertising and marketing services, short term and temporary uses like non-personalized advertising, auditing related to ad impressions, ensuring security and integrity of your personal information, debugging to identify and repair errors that prevent existing intended functionality of our services, and detecting, investigating, or protecting against wrongful, fraudulent, or otherwise illegal activity.
We provide your information to franchisees.
We provide identifiers, payment information, transaction history, usage information, demographic information, and location information to franchise organizations. We provide this information for processing your purchases of or requests for products and services, providing advertising and marketing services, short term and temporary uses like non-personalized advertising, auditing related to ad impressions, ensuring security and integrity of your personal information, debugging to identify and repair errors that prevent existing intended functionality of our services, and detecting, investigating, or protecting against wrongful, fraudulent, or otherwise illegal activity. Franchise organizations are independent businesses, and their processing of personal information is subject to their own privacy policies.
We also provide your information to third parties.
When we provide your information to third parties, and they receive the data for their own purposes, the disclosure is considered a “sale” of personal information under some U.S. privacy laws. We do not sell your information for money. Your information we may “sell” includes identifiers, usage information, and transaction history. The categories of third parties we “sell” your personal information to include advertising partners, data analytics providers, social networks, affiliates, franchise organizations, and data brokers. We provide this information to show you relevant and personalized advertisements (targeted advertising) and for analytics, data strategy, consultation on, development or improvement of products and services, marketing, advertising, and related services.
We will provide your information when we are required by law or to protect ourselves.
We may provide your information to respond to a court order, subpoena, or government agency or investigatory body request. We may also provide your information to investigate potential fraud.
We will provide your information in connection with business combination or similar corporate reorganization.
We will disclose your information in connection with any actual or proposed corporate reorganization, merger, sale, or other acquisition or business combination. We will disclose your information in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings.
We may otherwise provide your information as permitted by law.
Cookies and other tracking technologies
Dunkin’ websites, apps, emails, and advertisements may use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and pixel tags.
We also use tracking tools:
to recognize new visitors to our websites.
to recognize past customers.
to present more personalized content, to improve your website experience, optimize your shopping experience, and provide site and service enhancements.
to observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.
to better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.
We use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties to decide what content is relevant to you. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We or our partners might also look at your location. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others. We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.
Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop. Choices you make are both browser and device specific.
You may exercise choices to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
, by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at
https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb
, or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Most of the companies with whom we work to provide you with targeted ads support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance. This means that they allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across websites for online interest-based advertising purposes. More information can be found at www.aboutads.info/. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and other companies that participate in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, follow the instructions at www.aboutads.info/choices, or
http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices
. An “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements. Opt-out Cookies only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt-out of interest-based advertisements across all of your browsers and devices, you will need to opt-out on each browser on each device you actively use. If you delete Cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again. If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your mobile apps, please follow the instructions at
http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices
. Please note that when you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our website or mobile application. It means that the online ads that you do see from participants should not be based on your particular interests. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any other entity’s opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, other entities may still use tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other permitted purpose.
Your privacy rights
You have choices related to your personal information, and these rights may have different names under different laws.
You have the right to:
Access your Personal Data.
You have the right to confirm whether we are processing your personal information and receive a copy of that information. You can request this information
here
.
Correct.
You can correct your inaccurate information. This is generally completed by updating your account information.
Delete.
If you don’t want us to have your information, we don’t want to have it. You can ask us to erase your information
here
, but we may maintain some information for security, fraud prevention, auditing purposes or to comply with a legal obligation or governmental request.
Opt Out of Sales.
Some state laws define “sales” of personal information as the exchange of personal information for any valuable consideration (such as services). We do not sell your data in exchange for money. We do “sell” your personal information when we provide your personal information to another business, and they use it for their own purposes. You have the right to opt out of these sales and can do so
here
.
Opt Out of Targeted Advertising.
We use targeted advertising to present offers we think you may be interested in. You have the right to opt out of targeted advertising and can do so
here
.
You can exercise your rights
here
. If you have an account, requests to correct inaccurate information must generally be completed through your Account Settings on our website or app. You can also call us at 1-800-859-5339. We will need to verify your identity for security and fraud prevention purposes by phone or email.
You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia provide a formal right to appeal if we decline to take action on your request. No matter your location, you can appeal such a decision by emailing us at
customerservice@dunkinbrands.com
. We will respond to your appeal within 45 days of receiving the appeal. If we deny your appeal and you are located in Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, or Virginia, you can contact your Attorney General to submit a complaint.
You may also have rights that do not apply to us because we do not use your personal information for those purposes, such as the right to opt out of certain profiling and the right to limit the use of your sensitive personal information.
We have disclosure obligations in Nevada. A “sale” under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for money for a third party to license or sell to other third parties. We do not “sell” personal information as defined under Nevada law. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us at
customerservice@dunkinbrands.com
and include the words “Nevada Rights” in the subject line.

If you are under the age of 16, please do not provide us with any personal information. If you think we have been provided with the personal information of a child under the age of 16, please let us know (you can contact us using the information in the “Contact us” section immediately above). We encourage parents to teach their children to never provide personal information online.
California Privacy Disclosures
Below you will find specific disclosures required for our California consumers. We treat our guests equally, and you can use these disclosures no matter the state you reside in. Our Privacy Policy includes information on the categories of personal information we collect (
Information we collect
), categories of sources from whom we collect that information (
How we gather that information

here
. We will need to verify your identity by phone or email for security and fraud prevention purposes. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf; however, you may still need to verify your identity directly before your request can be processed. Your authorized agent may submit a request on your behalf using the webform or toll-free number listed above.
Loyalty Program and Financial Incentive Disclosures
We may offer loyalty programs (including Dunkin’ Rewards) that provide benefits such as rewards points and discounts to those who participate. From time to time, we also offer coupons, discount codes, or offers for free products that require a sign-up. Participation requires you to provide some personal information, such as identifiers, demographic information (age), usage information, and transaction history. The incentives associated with our loyalty programs are designed to reward loyal customers for continuing to purchase our products. For terms and conditions applicable to our loyalty programs, including Dunkin’ Rewards, please see our
Terms of Use
. For terms and conditions specific to Dunkin’ Rewards, please see our
Dunkin’ Rewards Terms
. We have made a good faith estimate that the value of the personal information provided in connection with our loyalty programs is roughly equivalent to the relevant expenses related to the collection and retention of that personal information. Any difference in price or benefits provided to customers who participate in our loyalty programs is reasonably related to the value of personal information provided. By joining our loyalty program, you consent to any financial incentive associated with the program. You have the right to withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by cancelling your participation in the loyalty program. You have the right to delete your personal information associated with your Dunkin’ Rewards account; however, if you delete your personal information, we will be unable to link your rewards to your account, and therefore you will be unable to receive benefits from the program. Additionally, we will be unable to recover your account after deletion.

Changes to Terms
We may change these Terms so please check back from time to time. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will inform you in advance by posting a notice within the DD/BR Online Services.  If you are a registered user or are on our electronic mailing list, we may also notify you of such material changes via email.  We may ask you to affirmatively accept changes to these Terms at the time of your next account sign in, access or use of the DD/BR Online Services.  All changes are effective when we post them and apply to your access and use of the DD/BR Online Services thereafter. Changes to the Dispute Resolution provisions (Section 20 below) do not apply to any dispute for which you or we have actual notice prior to the date that the revised Terms are effective.

notify Dunkin' Brands if you discover or suspect that your account has been hacked or its security breached.
You also agree to take responsibility for all activities on or under any account registered to you and you accept all risks for any unauthorized use of your account.

Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU AND Dunkin' BRANDS AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE
. You hereby agree that any dispute between you and Dunkin’ Brands and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, “
Dunkin' Brands
”) arising from or relating to (a) your use or misuse of the DD/BR Online Services (including without limitation any Dunkin’ Card or Baskin-Robbins Card), (b) these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof or (c) the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "
Covered Disputes
") will be settled by binding arbitration in Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (available at www.adr.org), in effect on the date thereof. If there is a conflict between AAA Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate will govern. For purposes of this section, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).
WHAT IS ARBITRATION
: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.
PRE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURES
. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advance written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Dunkin' Brands will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Dunkin' Brands and you must provide such notice by e-mail to
customerservice@dunkinbrands.com
with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject line.  During such 60-day notice period, we agree to endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.
ARBITRATION PROCEDURES
. To initiate arbitration, you or Dunkin' Brands must do the following things:
(1)    Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.
(2)    Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: American Arbitration Associate, Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.
(3)    Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.  If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Dunkin' Brands will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you.  If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Dunkin' Brands for all fees associated with the arbitration that Dunkin' Brands paid on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.
AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR.
The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
NO CLASS ACTIONS.
Dunkin' Brands and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only.
Neither Dunkin' Brands nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis
.
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dunkin' Brands in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND Dunkin' BRANDS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing Dunkin' Brands at
customerservice@dunkinbrands.com
and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) the URL of the Terms and Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms.  The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms by using the DD/BR Online Services.
If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced. In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, then such dispute between us arising under the Terms or your misuse of the DD/BR Online Services will be subject to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, and governed in accordance with the laws of the state of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of law rules.
Taxes
You are solely responsible for any and all duties, taxes, levies or fees (including any sales, use or withholding taxes) imposed on or in connection with these Terms or the DD/BR Online Services by any authority.
