Vivek and Elon are tasked with breaking the old governance systems and designing a new government and writing up governance policies. President Trump will drive the government with team and implement those policies. They are tasked with building a new America. They are America's Engineers and Scientists with a free hand operate without the impediments of politics. It will be a new EV (Elon Vivek) driven American government. This will put Vivek and Elon on top of almost everything in the government.,0.8074,0.095,0.0,0.905,2024-11-14_16-37-07

"The first thing Obama did after becoming President  was brag very soon about creating a million new jobs .  He did that he admitted on stage live in front of Americans on TV by hiring one million federal workers.  That's a verified fact.  Look it up.

That the exact opposite of what Trump meant eight years ago when he said 'drain the swamp'.  Unfortunately Democrats fought that for self centered reasons of power, control and greed.

Trump is now once more trying it again.  Trying to reduce government size, regulations, control, waste, taxes, greed and career politicians.  Now Trump is adding Elon and Vivek to his team because he knows they know how to cut waste and improve production and efficiency and effectiveness.  God bless Trump, Elon and Vivek for America's sake, health and prosperity.

"Choose life. Choose the planet you were born on, the one you’re standing on right now. Choose the oceans, the forests, the air you breathe, knowing they need our help now—not some distant planet in the void. Choose caring for Earth instead of dreaming about abandoning it. Choose real solutions here, instead of fantasies of life light-years away.

Choose a billionaire’s dream to escape, to build colonies on red deserts while the blue planet burns. Choose the allure of rockets, headlines, and billion-dollar visions, but ask yourself who really benefits. Choose watching as resources pour into Mars missions while entire cities here are left without clean water.

Choose a vision of humanity where only the wealthy, the powerful, the “innovators” get to imagine a future. Choose to ask yourself who gets to be on those ships, and what’s left for those who can’t afford a ticket. Choose knowing that the “Mars colony” sounds like survival, but for most, it’s just a distraction from problems no one wants to solve.

Choose wondering why we’re so eager to escape a world we haven’t finished building yet. Choose asking why we’re rushing to make a new home while ignoring the harm done to the one we have. Choose seeing Mars not as a dream, but as a reminder of what we’re leaving behind—the inequity, the pollution, the waste.

Or, choose life on Earth. Choose investing in solutions that heal instead of running from problems that we created. Choose valuing the planet that gave us everything before turning to one that offers nothing. Choose caring for all life, not just human survival. Choose staying, building, working together on this world until it’s a place worth keeping.

Choose life—not life on Mars, but a life we can all live, here, where we belong.",0.5585,0.129,0.102,0.769,2024-11-14_16-37-07
