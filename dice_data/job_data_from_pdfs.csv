Future of Tech Recruiting: How AI Will Change Recruiting
Automation has impacted recruiting for quite some time. However, the next several years may bring
recruiting’s biggest shift in decades, thanks to the evolution of generative AI and the increasing

recruiters can start adopting now. We’ll also share how organizations can prepare for the

benefits recruiters have reaped from AI, how those benefits came about, and where the future of AI and
recruiting is heading. Generative AI has been a game changer for recruiting Core metrics like cost per

Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back end developers have a vital task: they must build and maintain the infrastructure that allows the
front end of a website (i.e., what the user sees) to operate. While those end users may never think
about all the work necessary to have a site load instantly, back end developers are obsessed with
ensuring servers, applications, and databases can handle anything. Organizations everywhere need
their web infrastructure maintained, which is why there’s intense demand for back end developers with
the right mix of skills and experience. According to Lightcast, which collects and analyzes millions of job
postings from across the country, organizations posted some 28,865 back end developer job openings
over the past 12 months; projected growth for the profession is estimated at 19.2 percent over the next
decade. What Skills Do Back End Developers Need? Lightcast also offers a breakdown of back end
developer “distinguishing skills,” which are defined as the advanced skills these tech profess

Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back end developers have a vital task: they must build and maintain the infrastructure that allows the
front end of a website (i.e., what the user sees) to operate. While those end users may never think
about all the work necessary to have a site load instantly, back end developers are obsessed with
ensuring servers, applications, and databases can handle anything. Organizations everywhere need
their web infrastructure maintained, which is why there’s intense demand for back end developers with
the right mix of skills and experience. According to Lightcast, which collects and analyzes millions of job
postings from across the country, organizations posted some 28,865 back end developer job openings
over the past 12 months; projected growth for the profession is estimated at 19.2 percent over the next
decade. What Skills Do Back End Developers Need? Lightcast also offers a breakdown of back end
developer “distinguishing skills,” which are defined as the advanced skills these tech profess

Are Companies Actually Eliminating Hiring Bias?
For many executives and hiring managers, eliminating bias from their hiring practices is a top priority.
But are they succeeding? Hired’s new 2023 State of Wage Inequality in Tech Report explores that
question, and comes back with some good news: based on responses from 229 technology hiring
leaders and 1,075 tech employees, the perception of hiring bias at various companies has declined
over the past few years. Check out the chart: But that doesn’t mean hiring bias is a thing of the past: 56
percent of respondents feel that hiring bias is “definitely” or “probably” still present within their
organizations: “Over the past few decades, increased awareness of unconscious bias and its impact on
hiring decisions has led to various measures designed to address and mitigate these biases,” added
Hired’s report. “Human resources (HR) teams, diversity and inclusion officers, as well as hiring
managers, all play a crucial role in combating hiring bias within organizations.” However, companies mi

Employees: Our Bosses Aren't Doing Enough About DEIB
Most employees want their organizations to address racism, according to a new study. Edelman’s new
survey of 3,500 U.S. adults found that 62 percent “won’t work for organizations that fail to speak out
against racial injustice,” according to a summary by Axios. The same percentage said their companies
were doing “mediocre or worse” to deal with racism both within the workplace and the community at
large. Internally, companies are also struggling to confront issues around diversity, equity, inclusion,
and belonging (DEIB). For example, 61 percent of executives surveyed for the report said they were
uncomfortable “discussing race and racial issues with people of other races,” along with 46 percent of
mid-level employees and 43 percent of associates. Meanwhile, 42 percent of employees said their
companies’ DEIB efforts weren’t adequately resourced, while 30 percent said any return of investment
from those efforts hasn’t been effectively communicated to the larger business. Almost as many

Beyond the Numbers: Unveiling the Factors Behind the Gender Pay Gap in Tech
This year for Dice's ""Women in Tech Week,"" we analyzed survey data from our latest Tech Salary
Report, specifically focusing on gaps in responses from people who identify as women and men in tech.
One statistic stood out: a concerning gender pay gap, with the average annual salary for men in tech at
$114,000 compared to $99,000 for women. But there's more to the story than just the numbers. Let's
delve deeper into the factors behind this disparity. Retention Issues in Tech There is a clear retention
issue for women in tech. The following gaps make this clear: People who identify as men are more
likely to hold full-time positions: 86% of men reported being in a full-time role compared to 80% of
respondents who identify as women. Men are more likely to be in their current role for longer: 31% of
men have been in their role for over 5 years vs. 22% of women Men are more likely to be in the industry
for longer and report spending over five years in tech: 80% of men vs. 66% of women Accordi
Executive Presence: An Emotionally Intelligent Approach
At the age of 25, my career in cybersecurity started to take off. However, the farther I went up the
leadership ladder, the fewer women I saw in the room. And the more men tried to advise me on what
leadership looked like – sometimes literally. I was repeatedly told to work on my “executive presence,”
which proved to be a rather elusive concept. It began when my male supervisor told me that I needed to
cut my hair. He thought it looked messy. So, I cut it. (Though, I should mention, I made him pay for it.) I
also got my nails done and exclusively wore dresses and skirts, paired with high heels. I was counseled
not to smile too much or too little. I was told not to be either “too emotional” or “too frigid.” Try navigating
that confusing landscape! The male leaders around me said that adopting these changes were
essential to cultivating executive presence, and without doing so, my career could only advance so far.
While I can’t go back and ignore this advice, I can share what I now know

Companies Must Do More for DEIB
From the outside, it seems that organizations everywhere are pouring tons of resources into their
respective Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) policies. But as Dice’s latest
Discrimination in Tech fact sheet (our second) points out, all those DEIB efforts aren’t having the
internal impact that many executives desire. Among those tech professionals surveyed by Dice, some
36 percent said they were extremely or moderately impressed by their company’s actions related to
racial diversity, equity, and inclusion, while 37 percent said the same thing about gender-related efforts.
That’s significantly down from the 42 percent who felt the same way about their company’s racial- and
gender-related DEIB initiatives the year before. Meanwhile, some 20 percent reported they were
unimpressed with these racial- and gender-related efforts, up year-over-year from 12 percent. That’s
not good, and it’s not something that companies can afford to ignore, especially if they want to hire an

Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back end developers have a vital task: they must build and maintain the infrastructure that allows the
front end of a website (i.e., what the user sees) to operate. While those end users may never think
about all the work necessary to have a site load instantly, back end developers are obsessed with
ensuring servers, applications, and databases can handle anything. Organizations everywhere need
their web infrastructure maintained, which is why there’s intense demand for back end developers with
the right mix of skills and experience. According to Lightcast, which collects and analyzes millions of job
postings from across the country, organizations posted some 28,865 back end developer job openings
over the past 12 months; projected growth for the profession is estimated at 19.2 percent over the next
decade. What Skills Do Back End Developers Need? Lightcast also offers a breakdown of back end
developer “distinguishing skills,” which are defined as the advanced skills these tech profess

Tech Job Offer Checklist: Things to Consider Before You Accept
Evaluating a job offer for a technology job can be challenging. Today, most offers include several
multifaceted components, including cash, equity and benefits that must be valued, clarified and even
negotiated to reach an overall agreement that is fair and mutually acceptable to both parties. As the
saying goes, the money’s in the details—so let’s get to it. Here’s a look at the main components and job
details you should be analyzing closely before accepting or rejecting an offer. Salary and Bonuses
Understanding the cash compensation in an offer may not be as straightforward as it seems. Some
companies try to make their offers more appealing by presenting cash compensation as a lumpsum
amount that includes salary and bonuses—such as sign-on, relocation and annual performance
bonuses—but these need to be broken out and evaluated separately, warned Josh Doody, a salary
negotiation coach for high earners. That’s because some bonuses are a one-time thing, while others
may provide an annu

Spotting Red Flags in Your Interview Process
With the tech job market jumbled as it is right now, it is easy to make more exceptions than you
ordinarily would out of concern that options may be more limited. But there are a lot of important things
you can learn about a potential employer in the interview phase, and watching for red flags is a key part
of that process. According to a 2023 poll by Monster, “Sixty-five percent of job seekers consider jobs
that require more than three rounds of interviews to be the biggest “red flag” of a bad work
environment.” This could be an indicator that an employer is indecisive and disorganized, a trait that
can make a job very stressful. Here are some more common red flags to watch out for: Disorganization
and Disrespect Is the interview process riddled with last-minute rescheduling, strange communication,
or confusing behavior from interviewers? This can be a sign of a poorly managed company culture or
uncomfortable interviewers. Value Mismatch During the interview, keenly observe the compan

How to Prepare for an A.I. Job Interview
When interviewing for your next role, you may encounter a mix of chatbots and automated video
interviews as well as background algorithms collecting key data, according to the Harvard Business
Review. Based on video responses that candidates record, an artificial intelligence (A.I.) tool would flag
potential candidates who could be a fit. A.I. can analyze candidates based on traits such as word
choice, keywords and facial expressions, according to Bestcolleges.com. The interviews also
incorporate computer vision to analyze a candidate’s surroundings in the camera shot. So how should
technologists approach these new developments in A.I. that could change the interview process? Be

Project Manager Interview Questions: How to Succeed and Land the Job
During a job interview for a project manager position, hiring managers will focus on whether the
candidate can deliver projects on deadline and within a set budget. In light of that, project manager
interview questions could focus on everything from how you interact with other stakeholders to your
ability to analyze and solve challenges. If you want to “win” the interview, you should craft answers in
advance that demonstrate your care with budgets, your techniques for overcoming even the messiest
problems, and how you finesse team members so everyone’s doing their best work. Keep your focus
on telling a story, balanced with information on project size, budget, tech tools and outcomes; a story
will stick in the interviewer’s mind far longer than a litany of facts and figures. Strategies for Stakeholder
Management in Projects A project manager facilitates success for stakeholders. Seasoned PMs know
stakeholders can be a demanding group—managing their expectations is often critical to kee
Network Engineer Interview Questions: How to Prepare
Network engineers help businesses, and the world, stay connected. They design and implement local
area network (LAN) and wide area networks (WAN) to support a connected world, keeping security top
of mind as they work. Without network engineers, digital communication would be tedious, and in many
cases, not possible. Because the role is so vital, being prepared for your interview is
crucial—companies want to know that you have what it takes to keep their networks operating smoothly
with an absolute minimum of issues or downtime. A solid first impression lets hiring managers know
you’re qualified; beyond that, you’ll need to show that you have the technical skills to implement, iterate,
and evolve networks. During the job interview process, network engineers can expect a series of
questions that range from the technical (such as the tools and techniques you’ve used to build and
maintain networks) to the interpersonal (such as how you’ve used “soft skills” like communication and
empathy
Front End Developer Interview Questions: 5 Big Things to Know
Front-end developers have a crucial job: they must ensure that all user-facing parts of a website or app
work perfectly. It’s also a job that’s steadily evolving, which makes preparing for a front-end developer
job interview that much harder. Front-end developers are involved in everything that impacts the
navigation, layout, and design elements of desktop and mobile sites and apps. That means they must
be skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; in addition, they must have great “soft skills” such as
communication and teamwork, as they’re often working in multi-disciplinary teams with back-end
developers, designers, and others. In 2024, 66 percent of the world’s population uses the web, and 95
percent of them access it via smartphones, according to a report published by Datareportal. This
means billions use the web daily, all interacting with the work front-end developers do. Creating a great
webpage or web app is a tightrope front-end developers must walk. Finding a resonant design that
Business Analyst Interview Questions: How to Answer to Land the Job
Business analysts use tools, skills, and their own intuition to glean insights from massive amounts of
company and industry data. It’s a complex job, and the business analyst job interview process is often
complex, as well; you have to demonstrate a range of technical and “soft” skills (such as
communication and empathy). When preparing for a business analyst job interview, Josh Drew,
regional manager at Robert Half Technology, said it’s critical to do research on the company before the
meeting and gain some insights into the organization’s needs, as well as its history and recent projects
and developments. “We could never emphasize enough—get on the company's website, know what
the company's product is and what their business model is,” he said. At the start of an interview,
candidates are likely to field questions about their previous experience, including their past employers.
There could also be industry- or even department-specific questions about the processes you’ve used,

Data Analyst Interview Questions: Showing You Have the Skills for the Job
Data analysts help leaders make informed decisions, optimize operations, understand their customers,
and enable companies to understand where they might have an advantage. Companies expect
analysts to be great problem solvers with a strong technical skillset. Vladislav Bilay, DevOps engineer
at Aquiva Labs, tells Dice: “Data analysis relies on tools like Python, R, SQL, and Excel to extract
insights from data. Python and R are powerful for data manipulation and statistical analysis, while SQL
is key for querying databases and joining tables. Excel, though basic, remains widely used for quick
analysis and visualization.” Strong and insightful data analysis, knowledge of SQL, and programming
languages like Python and R are critical competencies that every data analyst must have. But how
does that impact the ebb and flow of a data analyst job interview? During a job interview, data analysts
can expect to field a variety of questions. Hiring managers and recruiters are interested in whethe

Future of Tech Recruiting: How AI Will Change Recruiting
Dice Staff
Dec 5, 2023
9 min read
Automation has impacted recruiting for quite some time. However, the next several years may bring
recruiting’s biggest shift in decades, thanks to the evolution of generative AI and the increasing
adoption of conversational AI, which may prove pivotal for recruiting teams and staffing firms.
Here’s how generative AI has already changed recruiting, how it’s evolving, and which AI applications
recruiters can start adopting now. We’ll also share how organizations can prepare for the
transformations and greater recruiting efficiencies promised by conversational AI.
Here are the topline benefits recruiters have reaped from AI, how those benefits came about, and
where the future of AI and recruiting is heading.
Generative AI has been a game changer for recruiting
Core metrics like cost per hire, time to hire, redeployment (for staffing firms), and candidate satisfaction
have been drastically improved by AI over the past five or so years, as it reduces mundane, repetitive
tasks and frees recruiters to focus instead on 1:1 communication and relationship
building
. For instance, researchers from
Gartner
recently found that 64% of the HR professionals they surveyed reported decreased times to fill roles
thanks to generative AI.
Early days of AI and automation in tech recruiting
The overall interest in adopting automation and generative AI sprung in large part from a desire to
increase efficiency among recruiting teams, as a LinkedIn
survey
back in 2018 suggested.
Tech recruiters in particular tended to be early adopters of AI and automation. They saw the potential
impact these technologies could have on day-to-day operations, since they were oftentimes surrounded
by technical talent deploying these same technologies internally in different applications.
And it quickly became clear for early adopters that layering generative AI with automation would have
profound impacts on the candidate experience. AI and automation (offered via simple, intuitive UI)
allowed recruiting teams to address or entirely eliminate pressing candidate complaints—specifically
slow responses from recruiters and limited communication.
The first “real” interactions many recruiters had with AI and automation were with seemingly simple yet
impactful email automation (and later, text message automation). Another powerful and early
application of generative AI in recruiting focused on the ROI enhancement of tech stacks. Specifically,
many recruiters used AI to improve the health of the candidate data in their ATSs, as well as their ability
to send relevant job openings to candidates. By applying AI and automation in these ways, many
organizations saw improvements in core metrics like cost per hire, time to hire and, for staffing firms,
redeployment.
The generative AI “future” is now
Generative AI’s recent rapid improvements promise even greater efficiency and ROI for recruiters. The
future of generative AI is right now, and AI’s most powerful applications have evolved to include
targeted job matching, prescreening, scheduling, FAQs, and job descriptions. While new, innovative
platforms and tools frequently enter the market, we’ve included links to some of the platforms and tools
we know are currently offering these cutting-edge generative AI capabilities.
Job matching
The right AI tools will regularly comb through your database to match new job postings or reqs directly
to candidates, reducing job board spend, time to hire, and cost per hire. What’s more, AI and
automation can send candidates who’ve applied an instant email with additional job matches they may
be a fit for—this will be particularly powerful for staffing firms. Platforms like
Pymetrics
and
Zoho
currently offer this functionality.
Prescreening
Job seekers apply to 13 positions at a time on average (according to the latest
data
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics), leaving recruiters with a deluge of applications to sift through. But
with technical talent in such high demand, time is of the essence. Getting time with talent for
prescreens can take days, and top talent will often be snagged in the interim. That’s why eliminating or
accelerating certain steps of the hiring process is essential, regardless of the day and time.
With AI-powered prescreening, candidates who apply after business hours can get “instant” responses,
avoiding the back-and-forth of coordinating meetings and then going through a prescreen. Generative
AI can ask candidates predetermined questions right after they apply and politely inform candidates if
they’re not a good fit. Platforms such as
Phenom
and
HireVue
offer this kind of functionality.
Scheduling
But, if a candidate is a fit, generative AI can then schedule an interview directly to your recruiters’
calendars. No back and forth messaging and attempts to sync calendars required. AI-powered
rescreening and scheduling can take place within minutes of someone applying, 24/7, 365 days a year.
Platforms such as
Paradox
and
Bullhorn
currently offer this functionality.
FAQs
AI can enable “smart” FAQs that use natural language processing to understand a variety of terms and
sentence structures to accurately and instantly answer candidate questions. These FAQs can answer
questions about specific jobs and job requirements and even recommend jobs based on criteria.
Platforms like
iCIMS
and
Sense
offer this functionality.
Job descriptions
By analyzing industry trends, “learning” your company culture, and understanding specific job
requirements, your technology platform can mobilize AI to generate engaging job descriptions and
postings that are more likely to convert visitors into candidates eager to apply. Solutions from
Workable
and
Jasper
offer this functionality.
Conversational AI coupled with generative AI will be just as pivotal
Generative AI continues to evolve and offer more ways to empower recruiters to operate efficiently
while building stronger relationships with talent. With that in mind, we predict that the next AI-powered
transformation in tech recruiting will come from the combination of conversational AI with generative AI.
The main difference between conversational AI and generative AI is that the latter can produce multiple
types of content in response to a query or prompt (for example, ChatGPT offering an answer to a math
problem or a joke). Meanwhile, conversational AI provides answers to specific human questions, often
along a particular topic (for example, a customer-service chatbot recognizing a human question about a
service or problem and responding with a specific answer).
Conversational AI applications in recruiting could work much like highly advanced versions of the AI
chatbots we see now (which read inputs and generate predetermined responses based on those
inputs). These applications could tremendously impact prescreening, job matching, and scheduling.
Tech candidates who engage with recruitment applications of this technology may even be able to have
a conversation with the digital persona of an employer’s brand.
These hyper-charged recruiting chatbots might be able to conduct human-like conversations and
perhaps pick up on non-verbal cues (think, facial expressions and gestures via video), all while
exhibiting empathy, reasoning, and trust. Next-generation interactions will be designed to make
candidates feel like they are having a dialogue with something that knows how to help them rather than
just going through the motions with a simple chatbot.
Benefits of conversational AI in tech recruiting
Conversational AI will change the game for recruiter efficiency, interviews, and scalability.
Conversational AI won’t just continue to improve candidate experience with frictionless experiences
(everyone has experience with a chatbot just not getting it); it will likely serve as a central hub for your
recruiting team. This means your recruiters will be able to interact with conversational AI to ask it to
help with tasks (without specific input), to answer questions about certain candidates, and more.
With conversational AI at the hub and generative AI continuing to improve efficiency, we anticipate that
organizations will increasingly consolidate their point solutions, turning to platforms that offer multiple
functionalities all in one place (rather than relying on multiple platforms at a time). This will streamline
efficiency and costs across the board and go a long way in creating better experiences for both
recruiting teams and technical talent.
In terms of candidate experience, conversational AI may soon be able to conduct virtual interviews,
which can remove the burden of high volumes of early interviews from recruiters and allow them to
concentrate on strong-fit talent. As we mentioned before, conversational AI solutions may be able to
react in real-time during interviews and show empathy. And post-interview, conversational AI could
measure candidate performance and provide assessments to recruiters so they can make the best
choice on whom to move forward with. Conversational AI could also be able to use certain criteria to
help quickly filter out ineligible candidates.
These and other conversational AI applications will help enterprise organizations and staffing firms
scale their efforts significantly. Recruiters can vet more and more candidates in less and less time so
they can ensure talent receives the exceptional experiences that strengthen employer brands.
The corners that shouldn’t be cut
AI has proven game-changing for recruiting and the future is both bright and exciting for technical
recruiters. That said, it’s critical for AI developers and recruiters and their organizations to prioritize
ethics, and ensure that applications of AI in recruiting eliminate bias and provide a fair and efficient
experience for everyone.
Whether you are a seasoned AI adopter or venturing into AI for the first time, we hope we’ve equipped
you with the insights you need to take the future of tech recruiting and AI by storm. If you haven’t yet,
check out the rest of our Future of Tech Recruiting series: we have entries on the evolution of
skills-based recruiting, the “workplace,” and recruitment marketing.

4 Tips to Transform Online Connections Into Meaningful Professional Relationships
Connecting online with subject matter experts and colleagues has become a popular way to expand
your professional network. In fact, statistics show that 40 percent of people network more online than
in-person. However, when it comes to professional networking, connecting is only the beginning. The
real challenge is guiding new “digital” connections with colleagues and tech hiring managers toward
meaningful follow-up conversations and real professional relationships. Fortunately, there are ways to
make this happen. Here are four methods for transforming online connections into meaningful
professional relationships. Connect On Purpose, For a Purpose Don’t cold-connect randomly. Review
the person’s profile and figure out why you want to connect before you reach out to someone online,
advised Bill McCormick, founder and owner of Digi-Sales, a professional training and coaching firm.

How Tech Pros Can Thrive in Their First Management Role
Not every tech professional wants to become a manager. However, as you advance in your career,
chances are good you’ll end up managing a team at some point. If you’re going to succeed in any kind
of management role, you need a core set of skills, such as empathy and communication, in order to
help your team produce its best work. With all that in mind, let’s break down how any tech professional
can thrive in a management role. While becoming a manager might seem like an intimidating prospect,
it doesn’t have to be—in fact, it can become something you enjoy, provided you’re prepared.
Challenges and Benefits of Transitioning to Management If you’ve never considered a management
role before, here are some key things that you’ll need to master: Shifting Focus: You'll move from
focusing on individual tasks to guiding and motivating a team. This requires a broader perspective and
an ability to delegate effectively. People Management: You'll be responsible for fostering a positive and

Should You Apply For Tech Jobs You're Underqualified For?
If you’re currently on the job hunt, you’ve no doubt stumbled onto a job posting that excites you. There’s
just one little problem: the job’s experience and skill requirements might seem a little out of your reach,
especially if you’re a relatively new tech professional. Should you still apply? Given the demand for tech
talent (and the historically low tech unemployment rate), you might have a shot at a job that initially
seems like it’s out of your reach—provided you can convince a recruiter and/or hiring manager that you
not only have at least some of the skills necessary for the position, but also an aptitude for growth.
More than one company has hired someone relatively inexperienced based on their potential. Before
you dismiss any position, there are several compelling reasons to aim high: Faster Growth: Stepping
into a challenging role can accelerate your learning curve. You'll be pushed to develop new skills and

AI and Cybersecurity Engineers: What to Know, How to Grow
Cybersecurity engineers play a critical role in safeguarding an organization’s information systems and
data from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other forms of cyber threats. In simplest terms, they
design, develop, and implement security architectures that align with the organization’s tech stack.
While the role of a cybersecurity engineer varies from one organization to another—some may focus on
automation, others on application security—many are tasked daily with configuring firewalls, Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and other critical security tools. They also
need to understand and protect cloud, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), and zero-trust
environments. These professionals don’t usually shy away from technically challenging issues, even
during their more junior years. However, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has made the cybersecurity
environment infinitely more complex—both from a threat and a tool perspective. How AI Ca
Dice Reddit AMA: Senior Tech Pro Pay, the Rise of AI, and More
In September, we held another Reddit AMA on /r/cscareerquestions, covering topics from the current
job market to how much senior tech professionals can earn. It was a lively discussion! If you missed it,
check out the Q&A highlights below; we've also included links for more context. As I mentioned in the
introduction to this AMA, it’s a complicated time for the tech industry. Many tech professionals fear
layoffs, and there’s a pervasive perception that tech hiring is weak. Meanwhile, the rise of generative AI
is prompting questions (pun intended) among developers and engineers about the future of their jobs.
Fortunately, there’s also a lot of data out there indicating that those tech professionals with the right mix
of skills and experience have plenty of opportunities to expand their careers. (Note: we’ve also lightly
edited some of these questions and answers for clarity.) Q. How are tech-adjacent Agile roles—Scrum
masters, Agile coaches, Agile product owners (if that's separate)—doi
What to Do When Low Turnover Stifles Your Career
While a high attrition rate is often blamed for problems like higher organizational costs and lower
productivity in the tech industry, employee churn actually provides “hidden benefits” that boost job
satisfaction for the remaining workers. When employees change jobs frequently, it facilitates both
lateral and upward mobility, allowing technology pros to advance their careers by acquiring new skills
and experience. Growth opportunities can come along unexpectedly, sparking your interest in a new
technology or field. The question then becomes: how can you keep your career from stagnating during
times like these when turnover, especially in positions involving legacy skills, slows to a crawl? Here
are some ways to reignite learning and growth when there are fewer opportunities to advance and your
career seems at risk of stalling out. Look in Your Own Backyard Don’t assume that you have to stay
stuck in neutral just because job openings are down. There are plenty of opportunities to add c
AI Tools for Coding Documentation: Which are Best for You?
Since their first day of learning to code, software developers are told of the importance of including
comments in their code. For those totally new to coding, comments explain how the following few lines
of code work; they help future developers understand what you’re doing and why. Very few developers
enjoy writing comments, and a lot of production code lives out in the world with little or no commentary.
That’s where AI tools can help. Today’s generative AI tools can read lines of code and automatically
generate comments so you don’t have to. However, it’s important to discern the limits of these tools,
because a developer who misuses them while coding can cause issues that ripple throughout an
organization for years to come. For instance, they don’t analyze your code and create documentation
for your end users (there are almost certainly companies starting to build such tools, but technologically
speaking, we’re not quite there yet). Let’s jump in! The Tool Rundown ChatGPT: ChatGPT
AI Tools for Data Analytics: Which are Best for You?
Data analysis has no shortage of AI tools, making it overwhelming to determine what’s available and
what might help when it comes to analyzing huge datasets. Let’s try to sort out at least some of the
confusion by examining some AI tools that work within existing data analysis workflows. Chatbots and
Virtual Assistants Chatbots are ubiquitous to any type of programming work these days, especially the
newest generative AI chatbots (such as ChatGPT). These tools can offer help with data analytics in
several ways. For example, they can offer coding advice. If you’re writing some Python code, for
instance, you can copy it into the chatbot and ask for help. Chatbots can also be used for teaching and
training, such as suggesting which tools are best for a particular job. Here are some general purpose
chatbots popular among data people and coders: ChatGPT: Everyone knows this one, of course; while
trained on a whole world of knowledge, ChatGPT also excels in coding and data analysis. The newe

Title: Introduction - 2024 Dice Tech Salary Report -,Tech Professionals,URL: https://www.dice.com/technologists/ebooks/tech-salary-report,Introduction - 2024 Dice Tech Salary Report - Tech Professionals,The Dice Tech Salary Report,"Executive Summary
In many ways, 2023 was another year of significant change for technology professionals. During the
pandemic, organizations across the country were forced to go all-remote, and consumers were
homebound; both groups spent quite a bit more time on cloud-based apps and services, boosting tech
companies’ revenues to new heights. But that situation couldn’t sustain itself, and as fears of a
recession began to build near the end of 2022, companies cut back on their
cloud spending
. The result was a surge of tech layoffs in early 2023, with some of the biggest names in tech (Google,
Meta, Amazon and others) reducing their respective headcounts by thousands of workers.
Despite that wave of cuts, accompanied by an implosion of many startups, a recession never hit.
Layoffs dipped throughout the rest of 2023, and the tech unemployment rate remained low, hinting at
robust demand throughout the economy for tech professionals with the right mix of skills and
experience.
AI took center stage early in 2023 as ChatGPT, the flagship generative AI product from startup OpenAI,
hit 100 million weekly users
. Bloomberg suggests that Generative AI will become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. Some experts
predict that, as early as 2024, we will see
widespread deployment of AI
across a number of industries. AI will fundamentally change how most tech professionals do their jobs,
automating many processes and even creating new opportunities (such as chatbot building and prompt
engineering); in order to seize those opportunities, however, these professionals will need to upgrade
their current skillsets and embrace cutting-edge technologies.
After an undeniably tough year for tech jobs, 2024 could offer more opportunities for many tech
professionals. In our
2023 Tech Sentiment report,
we reported that tech professionals are positive about the overall market, with 82% predicting growth
for the tech profession over the next five years.
Given this context, we are thrilled to release the 19th edition of the Dice Tech Salary Report, our
industry-wide source for insights into average technology professional salaries across the U.S.
In this report, we will compare salaries using various indicators like location, occupation, years of
experience, and skills, and explore the challenges and benefits that matter to tech professionals today.
Key Takeaways
Tech salary growth slowed between 2022 and 2023
While many tech professionals managed to grow their careers in 2023, those professionals relatively
early in their careers (i.e. five years of experience or less) were most impacted by uncertain market
conditions.
Read More
The average dissatisfaction toward current compensation has increased since 2022
Forty-nine percent of tech professionals are satisfied with their compensation. This is down significantly
from 2022 (at 55%), potentially due to a combination of rising costs (caused by inflation and other
economic factors) and a flattening of the average tech salary. More tenured tech professionals (who
tend to earn more) are more likely to be satisfied with their compensation.
Read More
Alternative benefits offer a strong avenue for employer differentiation
Traditional benefits (health insurance, PTO and 401k) have maintained status as must-have benefits
for the third year in a row. Employers hoping to differentiate should offer stock programs, work-from
home stipends, wellness programs and fitness reimbursements to attract tech professionals.
Read More
Tech professional use of paid time off remains strong
After the significant increase in tech professionals claiming they would use all of their PTO between
2021 and 2022, PTO usage remained steady in 2023. This suggests more tech professionals recognize
the need to take full advantage of their allotted time off.
Read More
Increased focus on AI and data analytics
The networking and cloud arenas boasted some of the tech skills with the fastest-growing salaries.
Organizations will pay a premium for tech professionals who can build out on-premises and cloud
infrastructure, especially when that infrastructure powers cutting-edge initiatives such as AI and data
analytics.

Opportunities Abound for Tech Professionals With the Right Skills
The tech industry was roiled by layoffs throughout 2023, leading to dissatisfaction among tech
professionals; many are newly interested in jumping jobs, or even leaving the tech industry for another
sector of the economy. As a result, we predict that 2024 will be a year of significant turnover as tech
professionals act on their dissatisfaction and jump to new roles, possibly in new industries.
What does this mean for tech professionals? It’s potentially good news: recruiters and hiring managers
are aware of tech professionals’ interest in jumping jobs, and will do their best to put together
interesting offers. In addition to salaries and stock options, a multitude of companies across various
industries are seeking to attract specialists with a range of career-boosting benefits, including additional
education and training.
But you won’t have to jump jobs or industries to unlock those offers and benefits. Although companies
are still pushing against market headwinds and cut budgets, they’re doing their best to pay attractive
salaries for tech professionals, and many are getting creative when it comes to strategies for retaining
their best workers.
As we head into 2024, also keep in mind that specializing in “hot” areas of tech such as data analytics,
networking and AI can unlock new opportunities and higher salaries. No matter what your experience
and educational background, possessing key skills will attract the notice of recruiters and hiring
managers anxious to find the best talent. In that spirit, consider the best ways you can spend the next
12 months upgrading your skills; as our data shows, experts in key technologies can expect to earn
significantly more than their peers.
0
%
of employed tech professionals are either looking for a new job or willing to hear about a new
opportunity.
0
%
of tech professionals are satisfied with their current compensation.
Methodology
Collection of Data
The 2023 Dice Salary Survey was administered online by Dice.com among registered Dice job seekers
and site visitors between August 30, 2023, and October 31, 2023. Respondents were invited to
participate in the survey in two ways: 1) via an email invitation to Dice’s registered (searchable)
database members and 2) through a notification via website banner on Dice.com user profile page. A
total of 6,166 completed surveys are represented in this report (this number excludes unemployed
respondents, students, incomplete responses and those who work outside of the U.S.).
Data Weighting
In each year of the survey, the data are reviewed to assess the need for data weighting to ensure that
the overall data properly reflect the universe of Dice.com job seekers. Examination of the data from
2023 showed a weighted data adjustment was needed for two variables — gender and age. The impact
on the mean salary results from the weighting for the 2023 data increased the average salary by
+$7,898.
Job Posting Data
Job posting data was gathered by Dice’s partner, Lightcast (formerly Emsi Burning Glass), which has a
database of more than 1 billion current and historical job postings worldwide. Data was used from
Lightcast to complete city, occupation and skill callouts.

Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back end developers have a vital task: they must build and maintain the infrastructure that allows the
front end of a website (i.e., what the user sees) to operate. While those end users may never think
about all the work necessary to have a site load instantly, back end developers are obsessed with
ensuring servers, applications, and databases can handle anything. Organizations everywhere need
their web infrastructure maintained, which is why there’s intense demand for back end developers with
the right mix of skills and experience. According to Lightcast, which collects and analyzes millions of job

Preparing for Your Next Tech Role: The Onsite Interview
On-site interviews may seem like a relic of a bygone era, but companies everywhere are starting to
prioritize in-person meetings and having staff report to an office weekly. This re-emergence of
in-person coworking and interactions make for a dynamic working environment many aren’t familiar
with (especially if they’re used to video interviews). This renewed sense of purpose for in-person
interactions begins with the interview process, too. Companies are resistant to hiring someone via
purely virtual interactions if they want them to come into an office. The interview process might be
mostly video and phone, but chances are good that, if you’re close to an office for a prospective
employer, you’ll be asked to attend an in-person interview at some point. Job seekers often have a host
of questions and concerns about on-site interviews. We spoke with several experts to help get answers.
Why are Companies Still Holding On-site Interviews in 2024? This question gets right to the heart of the

How to Build Better AI Prompts for Coding Help
AI tools such as ChatGPT can prove helpful when you’re coding. In theory, you can provide the chatbot
with a description of what you need coded, and the platform will return the appropriate code snippet.
With that in mind, let’s see how we can take help from ChatGPT (and other generative AI products like
Google’s Gemini) to the proverbial next level. It could prove crucial to your next job. Asking AI to
Provide Code For the past couple decades, programmers have had a substitute for AI: the millions of
fellow programmers all working together to provide collective help. If you’ve spent any time on websites
like Stack Overflow, you know there’s an army of people out there who will quickly provide code
examples and advice in response to your questions… if the answer hasn’t already been posted on the
site for years. But just because Stack Overflow or commentary in a GitHub repo says code is correct
doesn’t mean it’s correct. Sure, if somebody posts an answer that’s wrong, others are usually

3 Ways to Upskill Yourself and Adapt in the Age of A.I.
Data shows that tech professionals are eager to learn artificial intelligence (A.I.) skills on the job, but
over half of employer-led training programs are falling short of meeting their needs. In fact, only 64
percent of workers think they’re receiving the training they need, and 57 percent find their training to be
inadequate according to a new report from Oliver Wyman. With generative A.I. projected to impact 96
percent of the key skills and competencies that software engineers and other specialists will need in the
future, tech professionals have no choice but to teach themselves how to use and work with A.I. The
question is how to move forward. Here are three ways to build A.I. skills through self-directed learning
both inside and outside the workplace. Start in Your Own Backyard Understanding the fundamentals of
A.I. is the same as learning anything new in technology, the best place to start is by becoming familiar
with the tools that are already available, advised Dana Lawson, C

How Is AI Changing Cyber Threats and Your Cybersecurity Plans?
For business leaders everywhere, it’s important to recognize all the ways in which AI will change their
organizations’ cybersecurity both in the near- and long-term. On one hand, AI-powered cybersecurity
tools will protect the tech stack better than ever—but this technology will also create new threats that
must be anticipated. AI isn’t just reshaping the cybersecurity landscape, in other words—it’s rewriting
the rules of engagement from the bottom-up. For instance, even mediocre cybercriminals can use a
new generation of tools to launch devastating (and personalized) attacks on employees and
organizational infrastructure. AI is being used to craft highly personalized and contextually relevant
lures that can mimic human communication with unnerving precision; for example, your employees
could receive a video call from their boss, asking them to wire money to a new account—but the “boss”
is actually an AI-generated “deepfake” controlled by a cyber-scammer in another country. AI-driven m

“Tech Connects,” Dice’s podcast, digs into the tech hiring, recruiting, and career topics that matter to
you. Subscribe on ACast, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iHeartRadio, Amazon Podcasts, and YouTube! Our
latest ‘Tech Connects’ guest is Carmen Hudson, an author and recruiting expert. Carmen has led
corporate recruiting teams, built recruiting software, co-founded a tech recruiting conference, and
trained recruiters. She’s also the author of the new book, “The Corporate Recruiter’s Playbook:
Strategies for Hiring Top Talent,” which offers essential advice to recruiters and corporate leaders
about how to attract and retain talent. We’ll chat about how recruiters and talent acquisition specialists
can use their communication skills and other tools to refine and improve their hiring processes, even
when things at a company get chaotic. We’re also inevitably going to talk about AI, as well. Here are
some key takeaways for you as you proceed along your own recruiting and hiring journey: First,
Manual Tester Interview Questions: How to Prepare
Quality assurance (QA) and manual testers have some of the most vital jobs in an organization:
ensuring software truly meets all specifications and requirements. On a day-to-day basis, their jobs
involve reviewing and analyzing system specifications, executing test cases, and collaborating with QA
engineers on test plans. If you’re applying for a manual testing job or QA specialist, in other words, you
need to prepare for a manual tester interview process that could focus on a variety of skills and tasks.
Co-founder at Learnix Center Larry Poltavtsev says: “A tester plays a crucial role in the software
development life cycle and ensures quality. The job of a software tester is to identify defects and report
them. They have to do the test case writing creation, writing detailed test cases covering various
scenarios, like positive scenarios or boundary scenarios. They have to do test executions, manually,
execute tests, and verify software functionality. “Manual testers have to identify,
Your Privacy Matters: How Dice is Making Your Job Search Safer and More Effective
There’s a delicate balance of connecting you with relevant tech job opportunities while also protecting
you from irrelevant or excessive communication from recruiters. We've been listening closely to your
feedback and understand that unwanted outreach can be more than just annoying – it can be disruptive
to your job search. At Dice, we take our role as an advocate for tech professionals seriously. That
includes not only listening to your feedback but acting on it. As a result, we continue to address the
spam experience that some of you have on the Dice platform head-on. First, by implementing robust
product features and enhancements to shield you from unwanted communication. And second, by
promoting clear expectations and better outreach practices among recruiters. Here are the new and
ongoing things we’ve built into today’s Dice experience to ensure it’s as positive, protected and most of
all, effective for both tech professionals like you, and the recruiters who are looking for you.
How Coming AI Innovations Will Give Your Business an Edge
It's still early days in the AI game, but we're already seeing many positive developments for helping
businesses—and their employees—operate smarter and more efficiently. And we’re only in the early
stages of this revolution. What’s coming next? By 2027, AI promises to have developed capabilities far
beyond what we see today, and that means crafting a game plan for investment is now critical. I believe
AI innovations have the potential to change the way humans interact with technology, both as
consumers and within the workspace. AI will accelerate an already ongoing change in the ways we
search and consume information, from a predominantly text world to a multi-modal world of video,
audio and new types of media. In that sense, I believe advancements in multi-modality are the most
promising for AI, making workers far more productive and smarter. For business leaders and those in
charge of talent acquisition and management, it’s time to begin strategizing how to deploy AI in ways

Body Language Speaks Loudly in Interviews
In the high-pressure environment of a job interview, your body language can speak volumes about your
confidence, professionalism, and suitability for the role. It’s largely responsible for an interviewer’s first
impression of you, and can let you build an excellent rapport with any interviewing panel. This article
dives into the art of using body language to your advantage, helping you land that dream tech job.
While not all of its advice will apply to every situation, keep it in mind as you prep for your next big
interview. The Power of Presence: Projecting Confidence Through Posture Your posture sets the stage
for the entire interview. A strong, upright posture (think shoulders back, core engaged) conveys
confidence and attentiveness. Avoid slouching, which can make you appear disinterested or timid.
Practical Tip: Imagine a invisible thread pulling you gently upwards from the crown of your head. This
subtle adjustment can make a big difference. Making Eye Contact: Building Rapport a

Why Informational Interviews Can Help Your Job Search
When you’re on the hunt for a job, you’re likely concentrating a good deal of your efforts on creating a
perfect resume, tailoring an online portfolio, and actually applying for positions. But you might be
overlooking one crucial tool that could help you quite a bit: the informational interview. At its best, the
informational interview connects you with the hiring managers, recruiters, and longtime tech
professionals who can help you land a new position, especially if you’re seeking to jump industries or
disciplines. As we’ve explained before, an informational interview isn’t a job interview. Instead, it’s a
conversation: You connect with someone working in your target role or company, and your goal is to
gather information and insights. It's a chance to learn about their day-to-day, the company culture, as
well as the skills needed for success in a particular tech Why Informational Interviews Can Help You

Should You 'Mass Apply' to Tech Jobs?
When you’re on the job hunt, it’s tempting to bombard hundreds of job openings with your resume and
cover letter, especially if you need a new income stream. But is ‘mass apply’ the most effective way to
apply for new jobs? Let's delve into the pros and cons of mass applying to tech jobs, and explore
alternative strategies to land your ideal role. The Pros of ‘Mass Apply’ At least in the abstract, ‘mass
apply’ has some concrete benefits, including: Increased exposure: Casting a wide net exposes you to a
broader range of potential employers, increasing your chances of landing an interview, even if it's for a
role you hadn't initially considered. Faster results: Submitting numerous applications quickly can lead to
quicker responses and interviews, potentially accelerating your job search timeline. Confidence boost:
Landing interviews, even if they don't result in an offer, can boost your confidence and keep your
momentum going during the search. The Downsides of ‘Mass Apply’ However, thi

Project Manager Interview Questions: How to Succeed and Land the Job
During a job interview for a project manager position, hiring managers will focus on whether the
candidate can deliver projects on deadline and within a set budget. In light of that, project manager
interview questions could focus on everything from how you interact with other stakeholders to your
ability to analyze and solve challenges. If you want to “win” the interview, you should craft answers in
advance that demonstrate your care with budgets, your techniques for overcoming even the messiest
problems, and how you finesse team members so everyone’s doing their best work. Keep your focus
on telling a story, balanced with information on project size, budget, tech tools and outcomes; a story
will stick in the interviewer’s mind far longer than a litany of facts and figures. Strategies for Stakeholder
Management in Projects A project manager facilitates success for stakeholders. Seasoned PMs know
stakeholders can be a demanding group—managing their expectations is often critical to kee
Network Engineer Interview Questions: How to Prepare
Network engineers help businesses, and the world, stay connected. They design and implement local
area network (LAN) and wide area networks (WAN) to support a connected world, keeping security top
of mind as they work. Without network engineers, digital communication would be tedious, and in many
cases, not possible. Because the role is so vital, being prepared for your interview is
crucial—companies want to know that you have what it takes to keep their networks operating smoothly
with an absolute minimum of issues or downtime. A solid first impression lets hiring managers know
you’re qualified; beyond that, you’ll need to show that you have the technical skills to implement, iterate,
and evolve networks. During the job interview process, network engineers can expect a series of
questions that range from the technical (such as the tools and techniques you’ve used to build and
maintain networks) to the interpersonal (such as how you’ve used “soft skills” like communication and
empathy
Front End Developer Interview Questions: 5 Big Things to Know
Front-end developers have a crucial job: they must ensure that all user-facing parts of a website or app
work perfectly. It’s also a job that’s steadily evolving, which makes preparing for a front-end developer
job interview that much harder. Front-end developers are involved in everything that impacts the
navigation, layout, and design elements of desktop and mobile sites and apps. That means they must
be skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; in addition, they must have great “soft skills” such as
communication and teamwork, as they’re often working in multi-disciplinary teams with back-end
developers, designers, and others. In 2024, 66 percent of the world’s population uses the web, and 95
percent of them access it via smartphones, according to a report published by Datareportal. This
means billions use the web daily, all interacting with the work front-end developers do. Creating a great
webpage or web app is a tightrope front-end developers must walk. Finding a resonant design that
Business Analyst Interview Questions: How to Answer to Land the Job
Business analysts use tools, skills, and their own intuition to glean insights from massive amounts of
company and industry data. It’s a complex job, and the business analyst job interview process is often
complex, as well; you have to demonstrate a range of technical and “soft” skills (such as
communication and empathy). When preparing for a business analyst job interview, Josh Drew,
regional manager at Robert Half Technology, said it’s critical to do research on the company before the
meeting and gain some insights into the organization’s needs, as well as its history and recent projects
and developments. “We could never emphasize enough—get on the company's website, know what
the company's product is and what their business model is,” he said. At the start of an interview,
candidates are likely to field questions about their previous experience, including their past employers.
There could also be industry- or even department-specific questions about the processes you’ve used,

Data Analyst Interview Questions: Showing You Have the Skills for the Job
Data analysts help leaders make informed decisions, optimize operations, understand their customers,
and enable companies to understand where they might have an advantage. Companies expect
analysts to be great problem solvers with a strong technical skillset. Vladislav Bilay, DevOps engineer
at Aquiva Labs, tells Dice: “Data analysis relies on tools like Python, R, SQL, and Excel to extract
insights from data. Python and R are powerful for data manipulation and statistical analysis, while SQL
is key for querying databases and joining tables. Excel, though basic, remains widely used for quick
analysis and visualization.” Strong and insightful data analysis, knowledge of SQL, and programming
languages like Python and R are critical competencies that every data analyst must have. But how
does that impact the ebb and flow of a data analyst job interview? During a job interview, data analysts
can expect to field a variety of questions. Hiring managers and recruiters are interested in whethe

Future of Tech Recruiting: How AI Will Change Recruiting
Future of Tech Recruiting: How AI Will Change Recruiting
Automation has impacted recruiting for quite some time. However, the next several years may bring
recruiting’s biggest shift in decades, thanks to the evolution of generative AI and the increasing

recruiters can start adopting now. We’ll also share how organizations can prepare for the

benefits recruiters have reaped from AI, how those benefits came about, and where the future of AI and
recruiting is heading. Generative AI has been a game changer for recruiting Core metrics like cost per

Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back end developers have a vital task: they must build and maintain the infrastructure that allows the
front end of a website (i.e., what the user sees) to operate. While those end users may never think
about all the work necessary to have a site load instantly, back end developers are obsessed with
ensuring servers, applications, and databases can handle anything. Organizations everywhere need
their web infrastructure maintained, which is why there’s intense demand for back end developers with
the right mix of skills and experience. According to Lightcast, which collects and analyzes millions of job
postings from across the country, organizations posted some 28,865 back end developer job openings
over the past 12 months; projected growth for the profession is estimated at 19.2 percent over the next
decade. What Skills Do Back End Developers Need? Lightcast also offers a breakdown of back end
developer “distinguishing skills,” which are defined as the advanced skills these tech profess

The Relevant Resume: Best Practices for Showcasing Experience
The ability to craft a high-impact resume is a critical skill for those looking to capture the attention of
prospective employers and stand out from a field of applicants. To draw attention to your special skill
sets, unique expertise, and wealth of experience, simply listing qualifications and former employers will
not be enough—hiring managers and HR people are looking for relevance. Along with knowing the best
days to submit your resume and the top technical skills to include, you must tailor your experience,
accomplishments, and expertise to the requirements of the job you're applying for. ""Relevance means
the person who is applying to the job is taking the time to tailor the resume to match the requirements
and the keywords of the job description,"" says Trish Orozco, technology recruiting manager for LaSalle
Network. She says employers want candidates who can not only demonstrate the technical skills
demanded by the role, but who can also articulate how their understanding of tren

Using AI to Craft the Perfect Resume
One of the benefits to modern A.I. is how it can handle human language, including reading, writing,
processing, and even improving written text. The science behind this is incredibly complex, and
thankfully we don’t need to understand it to use it. And we can make use of it in many ways, including
writing resumes. Can I use A.I. to write my resume? A.I. tools such as ChatGPT can be a big help in
writing and improving your resume. But the key is to realize the shortcomings of A.I.: these tools are not
humans, and they base their understanding of language on what they’ve read. They make complex
word connections, which allows them to understand the text we provide; and through such word
connections they can write sentences and paragraphs that sound like they were written by a
human–mostly. But spend some time with such tools and it won’t take long before you start to see
common themes to their wordings and phrasings. In other words, ChatGPT and other A.I. tools have
their own voice, just

Mastering the Art of ATS Tech Resume Optimization
ATS, or applicant tracking systems, are utilized by companies to help with the management of the
hiring process for a variety of roles. These platforms assist recruiters and other staff in tracking
applicants’ status vis-a-vis the hiring process, often with interviewer notes, and keep all relevant
candidate information in a centralized database. More advanced systems also utilize artificial
intelligence and machine learning to scan resumes, which is why optimizing your resume for ATS is
critical. This is especially true if you’re applying to a large company; at scale, it’s difficult for any HR
department to track applicants for jobs with dozens or even hundreds of candidates. Knowing how to
optimize your resume to pass the ATS scan and get in front of human eyes is important. What is an
ATS? An ATS is a platform, often subscription-based, that helps companies keep track of job
candidates. More advanced ATS will also scan resumes for keywords associated with the role. For

How to Write a Relocation Resume
People move to new cities for all kinds of reasons, both personal and professional. If you’re
contemplating whether to relocate, your resume could play a crucial role in showcasing your skills and
adaptability to potential employers. Here are some strategies and other things to contemplate as you
prepare your application materials. Understanding the Motivation Behind Your Move People have lots
of reasons to move. Perhaps their spouse has a great new job opportunity, or they want to try out the
lifestyle opportunities in a new state. Whatever the reason, moving is inevitably a big life decision... and
often a stressful one. As part of your application process, you’ll also need to explain to an employer
why you need to move, because the question will inevitably come up. In light of that, your relocation
resume must: Showcase adaptability Forecast professional potential Communicate a clear rationale for
geographical change If you can successfully answer those questions, you stand a better
What's the Best Way to Add AI Skills to Your Resume?
As anyone who’s mastered prompt engineering or model training can tell you, it’s a hot job market for
artificial intelligence (AI) skills right now. If you’re already learning as much as you can about AI and
how to apply it to your current specialization, congrats! But it also raises an interesting question: how
can you best display your newfound AI skills on your resume and cover letter? The question is an
important one, because many of the recruiters and hiring managers viewing your application materials
might not have a background in tech, much less AI. You’ll need to convey how you’ve already used
your AI skills to generate meaningful results, and how you’re continuing to master the intricacies of this
burgeoning field. Let’s jump in! Integrating AI into Your Resume Whatever job you’re applying for,
here’s a piece of evergreen advice when it comes to your resume: review the job posting and note the
skills it mentions, then list those skills on your resume and other application docu
Tech Resumes and Objective Statements: Benefits for 2024
Is a resume objective still necessary? Find out its relevance in 2024 and how it can enhance your job
application's impact. The tech job market is highly competitive, which means putting your skills and
expertise at the center of your resume is critical—but what value does an objective statement bring? An
objective statement, also known as a career objective or mission statement, is a brief, punchy
statement typically found at the top of a resume under your name and before your work experience. An
effective objective statement concisely summarizes a candidate's career goals and aspirations, all
based in the context of the job for which they are applying. It typically outlines: The type of position a
candidate is seeking. The skills or experiences they aim to leverage. Their overall career direction.
Along with a smart selection of power and action verbs used throughout your resume, the objective
statement brings velocity and verve to your application (just make sure it's also formatted

Resources and Tools for Creating the Perfect Tech Resume
Organizations are looking for the best and the brightest tech talent, and a well-crafted resume and
cover letter is your ticket to catching the eye of hiring managers and securing the all-important interview
on the way to your career goals. With organizations now broadly using application tracking system
(ATS) technology, which are used to make data-driven hiring decisions, it's important to ensure
formatting and keywords meet those rubrics. ""Everything's getting filtered down through these software
systems, so you want to make sure your formatting is consistent,"" advises Blythe Girnus, Vice
president of training delivery for CompTIA. ""These tools can also help you make your resume
straightforward and concise—two characteristics I can't emphasize enough."" She points out there are
multiple resources available online to help aspiring IT professionals put together a relevant and
standout resume to optimize your chances for success. Tech Resume Resources These online

Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back end developers have a vital task: they must build and maintain the infrastructure that allows the
front end of a website (i.e., what the user sees) to operate. While those end users may never think
about all the work necessary to have a site load instantly, back end developers are obsessed with
ensuring servers, applications, and databases can handle anything. Organizations everywhere need
their web infrastructure maintained, which is why there’s intense demand for back end developers with
the right mix of skills and experience. According to Lightcast, which collects and analyzes millions of job
postings from across the country, organizations posted some 28,865 back end developer job openings
over the past 12 months; projected growth for the profession is estimated at 19.2 percent over the next

Future of Tech Recruiting: How AI Will Change Recruiting
Future of Tech Recruiting: How AI Will Change Recruiting
Automation has impacted recruiting for quite some time. However, the next several years may bring
recruiting’s biggest shift in decades, thanks to the evolution of generative AI and the increasing
adoption of conversational AI, which may prove pivotal for recruiting teams and staffing firms. Here’s
how generative AI has already changed recruiting, how it’s evolving, and which AI applications
recruiters can start adopting now. We’ll also share how organizations can prepare for the
transformations and greater recruiting efficiencies promised by conversational AI. Here are the topline
benefits recruiters have reaped from AI, how those benefits came about, and where the future of AI and
recruiting is heading. Generative AI has been a game changer for recruiting Core metrics like cost per
hire, time to hire, redeployment (for staffing firms), and candidate satisfaction have been drastically

Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
Back end developers have a vital task: they must build and maintain the infrastructure that allows the
front end of a website (i.e., what the user sees) to operate. While those end users may never think
about all the work necessary to have a site load instantly, back end developers are obsessed with
ensuring servers, applications, and databases can handle anything. Organizations everywhere need
their web infrastructure maintained, which is why there’s intense demand for back end developers with
the right mix of skills and experience. According to Lightcast, which collects and analyzes millions of job
postings from across the country, organizations posted some 28,865 back end developer job openings
over the past 12 months; projected growth for the profession is estimated at 19.2 percent over the next
decade. What Skills Do Back End Developers Need? Lightcast also offers a breakdown of back end
developer “distinguishing skills,” which are defined as the advanced skills these tech profess

Back End Developer Skills You Need to Know
by
Nick Kolakowski
Dec 27, 2022
3 min read
Back end developers have a vital task: they must build and maintain the infrastructure that allows the
front end of a website (i.e., what the user sees) to operate. While those end users may never think
about all the work necessary to have a site load instantly, back end developers are obsessed with
ensuring servers, applications, and databases can handle anything.
Organizations everywhere need their web infrastructure maintained, which is why there’s intense
demand for back end developers with the right mix of skills and experience. According to Lightcast,
which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country, organizations posted
some 28,865 back end developer job openings over the past 12 months; projected growth for the
profession is estimated at 19.2 percent over the next decade.
What Skills Do Back End Developers Need?
Lightcast also offers a breakdown of back end developer “distinguishing skills,”
which are defined as the advanced skills these tech professionals can use to differentiate themselves in
a crowded marketplace:
Continuous integration
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
ElasticSearch
GitHub
Machine Learning
React JavaScript
MongoDB
Test Driven Development (TDD)
Big Data
Backend Development
That’s in addition to “defining skills,” which
are the day-to-day skills that back end developers need to fulfill their tasks to the best of their ability:
Software Engineering
Java
Python
SQL
Docker
Git
Unit Testing
Ruby
Software Development
Microsoft C#
Before a back end developer can focus on these upper-tier skills, though, they should devote their time
and attention to mastering ”necessary skills,” which Lightcast defines as the foundation of the
profession:
Node.js
Linux
Scalability Design
MySQL
Data Structures
Relational Databases
Scrum
Web Application Development
Agile Development
Different organizations will demand their back end developers possess different skills, of course; for
example, a company that’s put a heavy emphasis on the mobile web (and apps for Android and iOS)
might want its back end developers to master mobile-centric programming languages such as Kotlin,
Swift, Objective-C, and Java.
Where Can Back End Developers Learn These Skills?
Some developers opt to pursue a formal education, whether a degree program or bootcamp. But you
don’t necessarily need a degree or bootcamp certification to land a job in back end development. If you
can demonstrate that you have the necessary skills (and can apply them to complicated challenges),
you can potentially impress a recruiter or hiring manager enough to land a job.
If you’re a fan of online learning, consider one (or more) of the following learning portals to start your
programming journey:
Udacity
Codecademy
Coursera
Khan Academy
And if you’re stuck while studying, you can visit sites like
Stack Overflow
as well as key subreddits like
r/webdev
in order to ask questions and find answers. Once you have a top-level understanding of what a back
end developer actually does, consider starting with Linux and programming languages such as Python,
Java, and SQL; once you’ve mastered those, move onto more complex topics such as AWS and
CI/CD
.
For those just starting out, some organizations will be only too happy to subsidize a round of formal
training, especially in more advanced concepts. Always remember to ask a potential employer about
training and development opportunities;
given the current demand for tech talent
, they could be more than happy to offer up whatever you need as part of your overall benefits package.

Continuous integration
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
ElasticSearch
GitHub
Machine Learning
React JavaScript
MongoDB
Test Driven Development (TDD)
Big Data
Backend Development
That’s in addition to “defining skills,” which
are the day-to-day skills that back end developers need to fulfill their tasks to the best of their ability:
Software Engineering
Java
Python
SQL
Docker
Git
Unit Testing
Ruby
Software Development
Microsoft C#
Before a back end developer can focus on these upper-tier skills, though, they should devote their time
and attention to mastering ”necessary skills,” which Lightcast defines as the foundation of the
profession:
Node.js
Linux
Scalability Design
MySQL
Data Structures
Relational Databases
Scrum
Web Application Development
Agile Development
Different organizations will demand their back end developers possess different skills, of course; for
example, a company that’s put a heavy emphasis on the mobile web (and apps for Android and iOS)
might want its back end developers to master mobile-centric programming languages such as Kotlin,
Swift, Objective-C, and Java.
Where Can Back End Developers Learn These Skills?
Some developers opt to pursue a formal education, whether a degree program or bootcamp. But you
don’t necessarily need a degree or bootcamp certification to land a job in back end development. If you
can demonstrate that you have the necessary skills (and can apply them to complicated challenges),
you can potentially impress a recruiter or hiring manager enough to land a job.
If you’re a fan of online learning, consider one (or more) of the following learning portals to start your
programming journey:
Udacity
Codecademy
Coursera
Khan Academy
And if you’re stuck while studying, you can visit sites like
Stack Overflow
as well as key subreddits like
r/webdev
in order to ask questions and find answers. Once you have a top-level understanding of what a back
end developer actually does, consider starting with Linux and programming languages such as Python,
Java, and SQL; once you’ve mastered those, move onto more complex topics such as AWS and
CI/CD
.
For those just starting out, some organizations will be only too happy to subsidize a round of formal
training, especially in more advanced concepts. Always remember to ask a potential employer about
training and development opportunities;
given the current demand for tech talent
, they could be more than happy to offer up whatever you need as part of your overall benefits package.

Cybersecurity Burnout: Costing Enterprises More Than Money
The stress associated with cybersecurity is everywhere: alerts from the security operations center,
patching updates, the latest ransomware attack, zero-day exploits, the growing demands of
governance and regulatory oversights from government agencies. The pressure on CISOs and their
security teams can be intense, given how they are held responsible following a data breach or a
successful ransomware attack that can trigger a law enforcement investigation. In some extreme
cases, security leaders have been held criminally liable. The burnout associated with cybersecurity and
stress on tech pros costs U.S. businesses about $626 million in lost productivity annually, according to
a survey published by Hack the Box, a performance center platform provider. The results are based on
two sets of interviews each involving more than 1,000 security leaders and practitioners in the U.S. and
U.K. Beyond illustrating the stress CISOs and their teams are under, the results underscore why

Using AI to Boost Your Tech Documentation
If you’ve spent any time in software development, you understand the importance of documentation.
But for many tech professionals, writing and editing documentation is a time-consuming pain—and a
task they could accelerate through judicious use of AI. But how can you most effectively use AI to
complete documentation? Before we plunge into that, it’s important to differentiate some broad types of
documentation, including: Process documentation (breaking down how you did something) Product
documentation (here’s how it works; breaks down into system and user documentation, targeted at
different audiences) Requirements documentation (where’s what we need!) Planning documentation
(here’s how we’ll build it!) There are further breakdowns, of course, including: Technical specifications
Product roadmaps Troubleshooting/QA guides Tutorials Standards documentation Metrics

These 23 Tech Skills are the Most Difficult to Hire For
Companies everywhere need tech professionals for all sorts of reasons, from thwarting cyberattacks to
building the next generation of “smart” apps. But where are managers experiencing the biggest
difficulties in hiring tech talent? The latest edition of Skillsoft’s C-Suite Perspective Report offers some
key insights into that question, based on responses from 219 C-level executives who completed
Skillsoft’s 2024 IT Skills and Salary Survey. As you can see from the following chart pulled from the
report, cybersecurity topped the list of hard-to-hire tech specializations, followed (perhaps predictably)
by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, analytics, and cloud computing: For context, it’s
important to remember that the overall tech unemployment rate dipped to 2.5 percent last month,
according to the latest CompTIA analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data; that’s notably
below the general unemployment rate of 4 percent. Tech professions that enjoyed double-di

Tech Unemployment Made a Surprising Dip Last Month
The tech unemployment rate tumbled from 3.4 percent to 2.5 percent in September, the biggest such
dip in four years, according to a new analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data by
CompTIA. “It was never really a question of if, but when employers were going to resume hiring,” Tim
Herbert, chief research officer for CompTIA, wrote in a statement accompanying the data. “A broad mix
of companies viewed recent economic developments as the greenlight to move forward in addressing
their tech talent needs.” The broader economy gained 118,000 new tech positions, while employment
within the tech industry rose by 8,583 net positions. “Analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
#JobsReport data reveals new hiring was primarily driven by the subsectors of cloud infrastructure,
data processing and hosting (+6,000) and tech services and custom software development sector
(+2,900),” continued CompTIA’s report. “An estimated 6.4 million professionals are employed in core
tech occu
Are Tech Pros Using AI for Programming Education?
You’ve no doubt heard about tech professionals turning to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT to
learn new things about coding. But are a majority of tech pros actually using AI for programming
education? Or are they still relying on tried-and-true methods such as technical documentation and
how-to videos? According to Stack Overflow’s exhaustive Developer Survey, a significant percentage
of tech pros are turning to AI for coding tips—but they’re using other methods a lot more. Here’s a chart
based on data from 48,822 respondents: Given all the hype around AI, some folks might wonder why
more tech pros haven’t adopted ChatGPT and its ilk as learning tools. Stack Overflow’s survey also
found that 31 percent of developers and engineers seem skeptical of AI’s output to some degree; they
might not necessarily trust what a chatbot tells them about the nuances of coding. But looking at it from
another angle, AI tools are relatively new and have already surpassed other learning methods as a g
Tech Unemployment Ticked Upward Last Month
The tech unemployment rate ticked upward last month, hitting 3.4 percent, according to the latest U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data analyzed by research firm CompTIA. That’s still notably below the
national unemployment rate of 4.2 percent. Once you dig into the data, a more nuanced picture
emerges. For example, the tech services and custom software development subindustries added some
3,400 workers in August, even as tech manufacturing lost 2,500 workers. Job postings for tech
positions increased to just over 500,000 last month, while actual tech occupation employment declined
by 28,000 positions. “The bumpy stretch of tech labor market data requires the usual balancing of
shorter-term and longer-term perspectives,” Tim Herbert, chief research officer for CompTIA, wrote in a
statement accompanying the data. (Or as Charles Dickens once said: it was the best and worst of
times.) Employers remain hungry for tech professionals regardless of their formal degrees. “Job posting

GitHub Copilot: Deep Dive into an AI Assistant
Artificial intelligence (AI) has reached a saturation point where every developer needs to make use of it,
or at least consider integrating it into their current workflows. Among the most popular types of AI are
chatbots and code completion tools built into IDEs, including VS Code and GitHub Copilot. If you’re
using a popular IDE, and you want to be a developer, you must learn Copilot. (There are other
competing tools you’ll probably want to learn, too, especially Amazon’s Q for Developer.) Let’s take a
deep dive into Copilot and find out how you should direct your learning and practice. What is Github
Copilot? GitHub Copilot is an AI tool created by GitHub in conjunction with OpenAI, the maker of
ChatGPT. It’s a plugin for various IDEs, including VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, and even a fork of
Vim called Neovim. It includes a chat and a code autocomplete feature, and it functions essentially as a
second person in a paired programming scenario, helping write code, answer question
Are Tech Professionals Using AI Tools in Everyday Work?
How often are tech professionals actually using artificial intelligence (AI) tools for code generation and
other vital tasks? That’s a core question tackled by data from Dice’s new Sentiment Report, a
comprehensive look at tech professionals’ opinions on everything from remote work to office culture.
The Report, based on 520 qualified responses from fully employed technology professionals residing in
the U.S., found that nearly half (49 percent) of tech professionals who specialize in AI use AI tools at
least once a week, versus 25 percent of “generalized” tech professionals. Of the AI professionals who
use generative AI in their everyday work, 36 percent say that these tools make a significant impact on
their work. Meanwhile, 50 percent believe that there will be a significant impact to the future of their
work. On the software development front, popular tools for AI work include ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot,
Google Gemini, and other AI-powered chatbots; one recent survey indicated that te
