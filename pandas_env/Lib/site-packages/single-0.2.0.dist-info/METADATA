    Wrap a command with `single` to ensure there is at most single instance of the command at a time.
    This comes in handy when periodically invoking potentially long-running commands by cron.
    `single` avoids the problem of stale lock suffered by lock file approach. Even if the command
    crashes the lock is cleared.
